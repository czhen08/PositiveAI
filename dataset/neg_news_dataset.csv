"There are about a quarter-million migrant workers in Lebanon, many of them from Ethiopia, but as the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on the former country's economy, maids from the latter are finding themselves suddenly out of a job and dumped on the doorstep of the Ethiopian Embassy in Beirut. The Telegraph started reporting earlier this month on the phenomenon, which has left dozens of domestic servants abandoned and with nowhere to go. ""I was thrown on the side of the road like a piece of garbage,"" says a 20-year-old maid named Aseem. ""I am not garbage. How could she do this to me?"" The paper notes that Lebanese currency has lost 70% of its value since October, unemployment rates are rising, and the cost of staples has gone up threefold, all of which have helped drain people's savings accounts.And that has left many of the working-class and middle-class families, who typically can afford cheap live-in labor, with no way to now afford domestic help. With no real labor laws on the books for these type of workers—which means no minimum wage, no set days off or limits to hours worked, and no way to register complaints about employers—the system ""enables modern-day slavery in our houses,"" Farah Salka, the head of Lebanon's Anti-Racism Movement, tells the BBC. The first group of 35 maids dropped off at the embassy earlier in June have since been taken to an NGO-managed shelter, but as word spread, more maids have been left there to sleep on the pavement. Meanwhile, the embassy and Ethiopian ambassador aren't responding. ""I didn't expect [my employer] to throw me on the streets ... without my passport or any clothes,"" Aseem tells the Telegraph.

"An American man was among the three victims stabbed to death in a park in the English town of Reading, in an incident that's being treated as a terror attack, the US ambassador to Britain confirmed Monday. Ambassador Woody Johnson offered his ""deepest condolences'' to the families of those killed in the attack on Saturday. A 25-year-old man who's believed to be the lone attacker is in custody, but officials said the motive for the carnage was unclear, per the AP. ""Our thoughts are with all those affected,'' Johnson noted on Twitter. ""We condemn the attack absolutely and have offered our assistance to British law enforcement.""In addition to the three people killed, three others were seriously wounded in the stabbing attack Saturday evening in the Forbury Gardens park in Reading, a town of 200,000 people 40 miles west of London. The Philadelphia Inquirer named the American victim as Joe Ritchie-Bennett, a friend of James Furlong, a history teacher named by his school as one of the victims. Ritchie-Bennett was 39 and had moved to England from the US around 15 years ago. His father, Robert Ritchie, said his son worked for a law firm in London before taking a job about 10 years ago at a Dutch pharmaceutical company that had its British headquarters in Reading. The third victim hadn't been identified as of Monday morning, per CBS News.

"Skeletal remains found in Texas have been identified as those of a soldier from Oklahoma who was missing from Fort Hood, the US Army’s Criminal Investigation Command in Quantico, Va., said Sunday. The body of Pvt. Gregory Scott Morales, 24, of Sapulpa, Okla., was found Friday in a field in Killeen, Texas, after officials at nearby Fort Hood received a tip, according to Killeen police. Foul play is suspected while an autopsy is to determine the cause and manner of death, according to a release from Army CID public affairs chief Chris Grey. There is no indication Morales' death is connected to the disappearance in April of Pfc. Vanessa Guillen from Fort Hood, who remains missing, according to the Army. Morales, who was also known as Gregory Wedel, was last seen in August driving his personal vehicle outside of Fort Hood, the AP reports.He was to be discharged within days after his disappearance, the Army said. Morales joined the Army in June 2015 as a motor transport operator and had been assigned to the 1st Sustainment Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood since November 2016, according to the Army. A $25,000 reward is being offered for information about his death. As for Guillen, who has been missing since April 22, Fort Hood released a video on social media Monday pleading for information on her whereabouts, KWTX reports. ""I’m asking for your assistance. Somebody, somewhere out there has the piece of information that we need to bring Vanessa home,"" Major General Scott Efflandt, III Corps Deputy Commander, says in the video. ""We won’t stop this effort until we are successful. And with your help, we can be successful sooner.""

"A black man whose hanging death roused the ire of activists did indeed die by suicide, the New York Times reports. A family spokesman says video of Malcolm Harsch, 38, taking his life in Victorville, Calif., last month confirmed he hadn't been lynched. Sheriff's officials reinforced that by showing reporters video of Harsch hanging himself from a tree with an electronics cable near the homeless camp where he lived, per the Press-Enterprise. Sgt. Steve Allen told them Harsch took his life after he and his girlfriend angrily broke up and she threatened ""to make one of your homeboys my new boyfriend."" Harsch is seen in the video throwing donuts at her tent before taking his own life.The family spokesman, Najee Ali, reiterated that activists had to pressure the police to investigate. ""Due to the fact that he was an African-American homeless man with no family initially, his life and investigation were devalued and put on the back burner,"" Ali said. ""The stress from being homeless, the lack of hope and the despair led him to choose to, unfortunately, end his life."" Harsch is one of two black men whose California hanging deaths made headlines and sparked fears of lynchings. Family of the other man, 24-year-old Robert Fuller, say they're still waiting for results into a probe of his death. The Signal reports that dozens of Santa Clarita residents gathered Saturday in Central Park to honor the lives of Harsch and Fuller.

"A Canadian agency is investigating after a plane filled with 500 puppies landed in Toronto, and 38 of them were found dead. Others were ill—dehydrated, vomiting and weak, the Guardian reports.

Canadian law prohibits ferrying animals in an unsafe way that could injure them or cause suffering. There also are regulations to prevent spreading disease when importing animals, per the Globe and Mail. The airline said it was cooperating with the investigation and posted an apology online Friday, calling it a ""tragic loss of animal life.""Flights often leave Ukraine and Eastern Europe packed with young puppies brought west for resale, said an SPCA International official in Ukraine.

"Lori Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, died in December, but it was pings to his cellphone that led investigators to the bodies of Vallow's kids, who went missing in September. Human remains belonging to JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, were discovered earlier this month on rural Idaho property belonging to Chad Daybell, Vallow's fifth husband (who is not the father of either child). Both Vallow and Daybell have been arrested in connection with the children's disappearances, though neither has been charged with murder and authorities have not said how the children died. But East Idaho News reports that, per court documents, JJ was found wrapped in plastic and duct tape while Tylee was found dismembered and burned. CNN reports that authorities found, via Cox's cellphone, that Cox had visited Daybell's Fremont County property four times in September—including visits on the days after each of the kids was last seen.A friend says Vallow, who along with Daybell was said to be obsessed with doomsday prophesies, had described both children as zombies before their deaths. Tylee was last seen in Yellowstone National Park Sept. 8, and Cox was on that trip along with Vallow and JJ. Cox's phone shows he was then at Vallow's apartment three times immediately following that trip, the final visit starting at 2:42am Sept. 9. Later that morning, pings show Cox was in Daybell's yard for more than two hours, with a possible jaunt to a city five minutes away. About 14 minutes after Cox was last in the backyard, per the phone, Daybell texted his then-wife, Tammy Daybell (who died in October), to tell her he shot a raccoon that morning and buried it in their pet cemetery—the same part of the property where Cox's phone pinged. Neighbors also recalled seeing a fire on the property Sept. 9, which was described as unusual, the AP reports. JJ was last seen Sept. 22, and Cox's phone pinged from Daybell's backyard—again from the location where the bodies were later found—on Sept. 23.

"British actor Ian Holm, best known for playing an android in Alien and Bilbo Baggins in the Lord of the Rings film series, has died at the age of 88, per a statement from his agent, report CNN and the Guardian. ""It is with great sadness that the actor Sir Ian Holm CBE passed away [Friday] morning,"" the statement reads, adding his death was tied to Parkinson's disease. ""He died peacefully in hospital, with his family and carer."" Born in Essex in 1931, Holm became involved with theater early, winning a Tony Award in 1967 for The Homecoming. However, Holm's stage fright led him to leave theater after ""a sort of breakdown"" during a 1976 performance of The Iceman Cometh, which is when he turned his focus to film. He catapulted to international fame with his role as the android Ash in 1979's Alien, followed by a turn at playing coach Sam Mussabini in 1981's Chariots of Fire.Holm was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for that role, though he lost out to John Gielgud for Arthur. From there, Holm became what the Guardian calls ""a bona fide acting grandee,"" mostly playing supporting roles, including that of Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit franchises. The Independent rounds up some online tributes to Holm, including one from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts; Holm was nominated for six BAFTAs over the course of his career. ""We are very sorry to hear of the death of Ian Holm,"" the group tweeted, along with a photo of Holm winning his supporting actor award for Chariots of Fire. ""Charming, kind, and ferociously talented, we will miss him hugely,"" added Holm's agent. The actor is survived by his fourth wife, artist Sophie de Stempel, and five children.

"Alex Kearns was enjoying investing, family members say—spending time on Robinhood, a free trading app, and experimenting with the stock market. The 20-year-old had just started during the pandemic, Forbes reports, while he was home with his parents from college. But late Thursday night, he apparently was shocked to see his Robinhood account, though it showed $16,000 in it, was $730,165 in the red. He wrote a note to his parents saying he didn't approve margin trading for his account and didn't think a small account could incur such a huge loss. ""He thought that he had blown up his entire future,"" a family member said. ""I mean this is a kid that when he was younger was so conscious about savings."" He put a note on his door telling his parents to turn on his computer. When they did, they found a letter beginning, ""If you're reading this, then I am dead."" His body was found Friday.""How was a 20 year old with no income able to get assigned almost a million dollars worth of leverage?"" Kearns wrote to his parents. He said Robinhood let him take on too much risk, per CNBC, though he had ""no clue"" what he was doing. But when he last checked his account before killing himself, Kearns might have misunderstood what it meant, the relative said. His negative balance might have been temporary, lasting only until the stocks underlying his assigned options reached his account. To draw young traders, others in the brockerage business, including E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity and even Merrill Lynch offer started to offer zero minimum balances and no-commission deals. But many of the new customers lack the knowlege to succeed.

"A Colorado couple is charged with first-degree murder in the March death of their 11-year-old son, who was forced to drink large amounts of water. Father Ryan Sabin and stepmother Tara Sabin of Black Forest were arrested Tuesday after a months-long investigation and are now held without bail at the El Paso County jail, reports the Colorado Springs Gazette. According to an affidavit, the couple directed Zachary Sabin to drink water because his urine was ""really dark and really smelly"" and he had a bedwetting problem as a result of a hereditary condition. But the water turned out to be what killed him. In addition to finding bruises across his body and blood on his head, the county coroner's office concluded Zachary died of forced water intoxication after he was made to drink 96 ounces of water, or 2.8 liters, in four hours on March 10.Ryan Sabin, a public affairs sergeant at Fort Carson, told authorities he pressed his son to chug the water even after the boy started throwing up, per CBS Denver. A child witness said he threw up at least 10 times, per the Gazette. Zachary continued to drink water as the rest of the family ate dinner, then began to have a tantrum on the kitchen floor around 9pm. His father allegedly kicked the boy twice, then lifted him up, causing him to fall back and hit his head. Ryan said Zachary was acting strangely—staring, stumbling, and grunting—but began snoring as he was put to bed around 11:15pm. He was found dead the next morning with foam at the mouth. Both parents are charged with first-degree murder, child abuse resulting in death, and six counts of misdemeanor child abuse, per KKTV. The affidavit lists five other children, aged 2 to 15, as victims of abuse.

The eighth of nine children, also known as ""the quiet Kennedy,"" Kennedy Smith passed away of an unknown cause Wednesday at her Manhattan home, aged 92, reports the Washington Post. She wasn't simply known for her famous name. Kennedy Smith became ""the first Kennedy woman of her generation to take on a serious political role"" in serving as ambassador to Ireland from 1993 to 1998—a role in which she ""helped pave the way for a formal agreement to end decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland,"" per the New York Times. Against US policy, she visited the British province of Northern Ireland to meet with Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army’s political wing, Sinn Fein.Kennedy Smith, the widow of New York financier Stephen E. Smith, assisted Adams in traveling to the US, where he called for a ceasefire and the British withdrawal from Ulster. A ceasefire came six months later, in August 1994. When it broke down two years later, Kennedy Smith continued to advocate for peace and eventually saw the passage of 1998's Belfast Agreement. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. once said she ""may well be the best politician of all the Kennedys,"" per the Post. ""I felt I was in a position where I could contribute,"" she later said.

"The ""terribly painful"" sudden death of a congressman's wife in Kentucky has some preliminary answers. Gary Ginn, the coroner for Fayette County, tells People that ""an autopsy was necessary"" to find out what happened to Eleanor Carol Leavell Barr (known as Carol), wife of Rep. Andy Barr, as she had died suddenly Tuesday at the age of 39, with ""no explanation."" The initial findings: Her death looks to have been caused by mitral valve prolapse, aka floppy heart syndrome or Barlow's syndrome, a condition in which the heart's mitral valve doesn't close correctly, leading blood to leak the wrong way. Most people who have MVP don't have symptoms or suffer complications—meaning some may not even know they have it.""At this time of tremendous grief and pain, we ask for prayers for our beautiful, dear, and precious Carol, the greatest, most selfless and giving wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend anyone could ever have,"" Andy Barr said in a statement.

"The young teen who took a plea deal in the death of Tessa Majors was sentenced Monday to 18 months in juvenile detention, at least six of which will be served in a facility before he could potentially be released and monitored, USA Today reports. The boy, who was 13 when Majors was killed in a New York City park in December, escaped murder charges by pleading guilty to a single count of first-degree robbery; the other two teens who are accused, including the one who allegedly stabbed Majors in a robbery gone wrong, are awaiting trial as adults for felony murder and robbery. Inman and Christy Majors, Tessa's parents, released a victim impact letter after the sentencing hearing in which they make clear they do not agree with the way the judicial process has played out, NBC New York reports.""From December 12th until this day,"" the letter reads, ""the respondent has shown a complete lack of remorse or contrition for his role in the murder of Tess Majors. By his own admission, the respondent picked up a knife that had fallen to the ground and handed it to an individual who then used it to stab Tess Majors to death. The family can’t help but wonder what would have happened if that knife had been left on the ground.""

"About half of the world's mountain gorillas can be found in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. That number has just fallen by one, after local wildlife authorities say a male gorilla popular with tourists was killed by a poacher, per Reuters and the BBC. The Uganda Wildlife Authority calls the death of Rafiki, a 25-year-old silverback—who went missing on June 1 and whose body was found the next day in the UNESCO park in Buhoma—a ""big blow."" Rafiki's death appears to have been caused by a spear that pierced his internal organs, per a probe by the UWA, which notes four men have been detained, one of them with rope, spears, and wild hog meat in his possession. The New York Times identifies that poacher as Byamukama Felix. The paper notes that the last time a spear fatally wounded a mountain gorilla was in June 2011, per the International Gorilla Conservation Programme.The UWA notes that Felix claimed he killed Rafiki in self-defense when the gorilla charged at him. ""Whereas the purposeful targeting of mountain gorillas by poachers is rare, this incident highlights the threats posed to mountain gorillas,"" the head of the IGCP says. A UWA rep says Rafiki's death may have dire consequences for the 17-member gorilla group he led, noting his killing ""leaves the group unstable ... [with] the possibility that it could disintegrate."" The UWA says in a statement that the four detained men are being held at a local police station as they await trial; charges against them are unclear, though they could face life in prison or a fine of $5.4 million if convicted of killing an endangered species, per the BBC.

"Lori Vallow's relatives confirmed Wednesday that the remains found on Chad Daybell's Idaho property are those of Vallow's missing children, 7-year-old Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan. ""We are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us,"" the family says in a statement. ""This is the worst news we will ever get in our lives."" Officials have not yet confirmed the identities of the two sets of remains they found, nor have details on cause of death been released, but ABC News reports a prosecutor did confirm the remains are those of children. JJ and Tylee have been missing since September, and so-called ""cult mom"" Lori Vallow has long been suspected in their disappearance, Fox News reports. She and Daybell wed in November; they are said to have been fascinated with doomsday and end-times prophesies.Daybell was arrested and charged with felony counts of destroying and concealing evidence after the remains were found Tuesday; the dates of the alleged crimes listed on the criminal complaint are Sept. 8 and Sept. 22 of last year, the last known dates Tylee and JJ were seen, respectively. Vallow was arrested in Hawaii in February and charged with child abandonment and multiple other charges; she and Daybell were living there together at the time after fleeing Idaho. The couple is also under scrutiny for the deaths of their former spouses, Fox 10 reports. Daybell's brother also released a statement late Wednesday: ""We are devastated by today's news and the apparent role that Chad has played in what has transpired,"" it says. ""Some in our extended family are still struggling to accept the reality that Chad could have been involved in something so terribly wrong.""

"Prosecutors charged an Idaho man Wednesday with destroying or concealing two sets of human remains after police said they uncovered bodies at his home while searching for evidence in the case of his wife's two missing children, reports the AP. The remains, found at Chad Daybell's rural Idaho property Tuesday, have not yet been identified. But the finding marked a gruesome turn in an investigation that has drawn global attention for its ties to two other mysterious deaths and the couple's doomsday beliefs. In court documents, Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood said he believes Daybell—who reportedly worked as a gravedigger while attending college in Utah—concealed the remains knowing that they were about to be used as evidence in a felony court proceeding.Per a criminal complaint obtained by EastIdahoNews.com, Daybell was charged with two felony counts: The first count alleges Daybell hid, altered, or destroyed human remains on his property between Sept. 8, 2019, and June 9, 2020; the second alleges the same, with the dates given as between Sept. 22, 2019, and June 9, 2020. Daybell married Lori Vallow Daybell a few weeks after authorities say her children were last seen on those dates in September. Police began searching for then-7-year-old Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan in November after relatives alerted them to their concerns. Police in the small town of Rexburg say Chad and Lori Daybell lied to investigators about the children’s whereabouts before quietly leaving Idaho.

"Police may have made a grim breakthrough in the months-long search for two missing Idaho children. Rexburg Police Sgt. Gary Hagen says human remains were found at the Fremont County home of Chad Daybell, husband of mother Lori Vallow Daybell, who has been charged with child abandonment in connection with the case, the Idaho Statesman reports. Police say Daybell has been taken into custody but he has not been arrested or charged yet. The children, 7-year-old Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow, and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan, have not been seen since September last year and police have accused the couple of lying about their whereabouts. Police declined to say Tuesday whether multiple bodies were found at the home, reports KUTV.Police said earlier Tuesday that they and FBI investigators were searching Daybell's home for a second time in connection with the case, the AP reports. In a Jan. 3 raid, investigators seized 43 items from the home and used probes and rakes to search several sections of the yard, reports the East Idaho News. The Idaho attorney general's office said earlier this ear that it was investigating Daybell in connection with the death of his then-wife Tammy Daybell at the home in October. He married Lori Vallow two weeks later. Vallow's former husband, Charles Vallow, was killed by her brother, Alex Cox, in July. Cox died in December from what an autopsy determined was a blood clot.

Bonnie and her younger sister June started the Pointer Sisters as a duo in 1969, USA Today reports. Their older sisters Ruth and Anita later joined them to form a quartet; the sisters had grown up together singing in church in Oakland, Calif., and it was Bonnie's idea to turn professional.""The Pointer Sisters would never have happened had it not been for Bonnie,"" Anita's statement continues. The hits they recorded in the 1970s included ""Yes We Can Can,"" ""Wang Dang Doodle,"" ""How Long (Betcha' Got a Chick on the Side),"" and ""Fairytale,"" which made the group the first (and so far only) black group to win a country music Grammy and was later covered by Elvis Presley. Bonnie set out on her own in 1977, pursuing a solo career during which she recorded a disco cover of ""Heaven Must Have Sent You,"" while the Pointer Sisters carried on as a group without her. Sister June died in 2006 from cancer, and Bonnie's last recorded song was a duet with sister Anita dedicated to her: ""Feels Like June.""

"AMC may not be coming back from this. The movie theater chain, which shuttered all its locations amid the coronavirus pandemic, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday that it has ""substantial doubt"" it can survive, CNBC and the Wall Street Journal report. ""We are generating effectively no revenue,"" it said in the filing, which included preliminary earnings results showing that it expects to have lost $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion during the first quarter that ended March 31, and that its revenue fell to $941.5 million, a drop of almost 22% from the $1.2 billion in revenue during last year's first quarter. Results from the second quarter, which ends June 30, are expected to be worse. ""Substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time,"" the filing says.The company said its ability to weather the storm will depend on raising enough cash to fund operations as the closure continues. As of now, its cash balance of $718.3 million is enough to get it to the summer (when it currently expects to reopen) or perhaps a bit later, but ""if we do not recommence operations within our estimated timeline, we will require additional capital and may also require additional financing if, for example, our operations do not generate the expected revenues or a recurrence of COVID-19 were to cause another suspension of operations,"" the company says. ""Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all."" Operations are currently suspended through the end of this month. Even as governors start to ease restrictions, AMC noted that movie releases may continue to be delayed or moved to digital platforms by studios, and customers may not come back to theaters in a normal capacity.

That number—a quarter of US coronavirus deaths—is partial and likely to go higher. A letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports more than 60,000 cases of coronavirus illness among nursing home residents. A copy of the letter and an accompanying chart were provided to the AP. The numbers, which had been promised by the end of May, are partial. The letter said the data are based on reports received from about 80% of the nation's 15,400 nursing homes.""This data, and anecdotal reports across the country, clearly show that nursing homes have been devastated by the virus,” wrote CDC Director Robert Redfield and CMS Administrator Seema Verma. CMS, which is responsible for nursing home quality standards, also told the governors it is increasing penalties for nursing homes failing to comply with longstanding infection control requirements. A federal watchdog report last month found a ""persistent"" pattern of infection control problems in nursing homes even before the coronavirus.

"Christo, known for massive, ephemeral public arts projects died Sunday at his home in New York, the AP reports. He was 84. His death was announced on Twitter and the artist's web page. No cause of death was given. Along with his late wife Jeanne-Claude, the artists careers were defined by their ambitious art projects that quickly disappeared soon after they were erected. In 2001, he installed more than 7,500 vinyl gates in New York's Central Park and and wrapped the Reichstag in Berlin in fabric with an aluminum sheen in 1995. Their self-financed $26 million Umbrellas project erected 1,340 blue umbrellas installed in Japan and 1,760 blue umbrellas in Southern California in 1991.The statement said the artist's next project, L’Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped, is slated to appear in September in Paris as planned. An exhibition about Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s work is also scheduled to run from July through October at the Centre Georges Pompidou.

"A 63-year-old California man offered a position at an Amazon delivery center during the company's March hiring spree saw it as a chance to earn some money and avoid dipping into his savings. He died from the coronavirus two weeks after he started work. Family members say Walnut resident Harry Sentoso had applied for dozens of other jobs and was excited about returning to work at the Irvine center, where he had done seasonal work in the past; it had laid him off weeks earlier. They say he started feeling unwell six days after starting work but didn't want to miss a shift so soon after returning to work. He managed to work for four more days but started to self-quarantine on April 9, after his wife tested positive for the virus. He died April 12.Amazon has refused to release official numbers of COVID-19 cases among its workers, but employees nationwide have reported more than 1,000 infections and at least seven other deaths.

"Most TV watchers will recognize him as Mr. Wilhelm on Seinfeld, but character actor Richard Herd had a rich, decades-long career on the stage, big screen, and TV beyond his famous sitcom turn. The veteran thespian died Tuesday at his Los Angeles home of cancer-related complications, his wife of 40 years, Patricia Crowder Herd, told the Hollywood Reporter. Herd was 87. He died with his family around him, his rep said in a statement, per CNN. After a serious childhood illness that nearly killed him—he told the Patriot Ledger in 2015 he was saved as one of the first recipients of penicillin—Herd launched his career as a stage actor in New York. He made his movie debut in 1970's Hercules in New York, then moved on to play Watergate burglar James McCord in 1976's All the President's Men. Herd also appeared in such films as The China Syndrome, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and Get Out.It was his role as the bumbling Yankees exec and supervisor to George Costanza (Jason Alexander) on Seinfeld, however, that really put Herd on many people's radars. ""He was always doing things that never got done and always going over to Mr. Steinbrenner and apologizing to him,"" Herd said of his character in a 2016 interview, per Variety. The actor was originally from Boston and was actually a Red Sox fan in real life. He also made appearances on such shows as ER, Dallas, and NYPD Blue, and had roles in various Star Trek franchises, including The Next Generation, Voyager, and Renegades. In addition, he served as the third national VP for the Screen Actors Guild. THR notes his resemblance to the late actor Karl Malden.

Groundbreaking work to keep alive the nearly extinct northern white rhino subspecies—population, two—by in-vitro fertilization has been stalled by travel restrictions. And time is running out. The two northern white rhinos are female. The goal is to create viable embryos in a lab by inseminating their eggs with frozen sperm from dead males, then transfer them into a surrogate mother, a more common southern white rhino.

"A Miami woman faked her son's abduction after trying to drown him twice, with witnesses rescuing the boy from a canal the first time, and the second attempt ending in the boy's death, officials said Saturday. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said Patricia Ripley, 45, is facing attempted and premeditated murder charges and being held in jail with no bond, the AP reports. No attorney was listed in jail records. The boy, Alejandro Ripley, 9, was autistic and nonverbal. He was found floating in a canal Friday.

""She tried it once, and people rescued him. He was alive. He could have stayed alive. She intended, from all the facts of the case, to kill him."" Fernandez Rundle said an autopsy was being done on the boy Saturday to determine if he had other injuries or perhaps had something toxic in his system. She said no decision has been made yet on whether to seek the death penalty. Fernandez Rundle also noted that because the boy was nonverbal, he could not have told his rescuers what had happened with his mother: ""We talk about children being voiceless,"" she said.

"Coroner's reports for the 34 victims who died in a scuba boat fire off the Southern California coast last year show they died of carbon monoxide poisoning before they were burned, authorities said Thursday. All 33 scuba divers and one crew member died in the Sept. 2 fire aboard the Conception, anchored off Santa Cruz Island. The only survivors were the captain and four other crew members, who were asleep above deck. The Santa Barbara County coroner's reports list smoke inhalation as the cause of death for the 34 victims, all of whom were in the below-deck bunk room when the fire broke out, per the AP. The manner of death is considered accidental, says Lt. Erik Raney of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. The predawn blaze swept through the boat anchored off the Channel Islands for a three-day excursion over Labor Day Weekend.The survivors have said they awoke to find the boat engulfed in flames and were unable to reach the sleeping passengers or sixth crew member and had to jump in the water to save their own lives. Raney says the coroner’s office didn't do internal autopsies of the bodies. He said external examinations of the victims and black soot in their trachea, as well as toxicology tests, showed enough evidence of smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning to avoid autopsies. Some of the victims were wearing clothes and shoes, Raney said. One held a cellphone, while another grasped a flashlight. Their bodies were not discovered in their cramped bunks: some were found on the surface of the water, others inside the boat's hull or on the ocean floor.

"Pier 1, the seller of wicker chairs and scented candles, says it will go out of business and permanently close all 540 of its stores. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company said Tuesday that it was unable to find a buyer for its business after filing for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.

It will start going-out-of-business sales as soon as it can reopen stores that have been temporarily shut due to the coronavirus pandemic, reports the AP.Pier 1 traces to a single store in 1962 that sold beanbag chairs and love beads to hippies in San Mateo, California.

But in recent years, its sales have fallen as it struggled to compete with online retailers Wayfair and Amazon, which sell sofas and coffee tables at a lower price and deliver them quickly.

"At the start of this year, Dr. James A. Mahoney was preparing to retire after nearly 40 years working in the intensive care unit of a New York City hospital. When the pandemic hit, relatives and even fellow doctors urged the 62-year-old to stick to his plans. Instead, he worked day and night on the frontlines until a COVID-19 infection made it impossible to continue. He died on April 27 after being treated at University Hospital of Brooklyn, his workplace, where he started out as a medical student in 1982, the New York Times reports. Colleagues say Mahoney was a much-loved and incredibly dedicated doctor, who continued consulting with patients online even after he developed a fever and had to self-isolate.Throughout his career, Mahoney turned down job opportunities that would have taken him away from the underfunded, state-run hospital. ""He gave everything to that hospital,"" brother Melvin Mahoney, a doctor who retired in 2014, tells the Washington Post. ""He gave his life for that hospital."" Mahoney's boss. Dr. Robert F. Foronjy, says older doctors were given the opportunity to step back. ""It just seems so unjust that someone who was this benevolent, this selfless, this kind, this skilled could be brought down by this disease,"" says Foronjy, who has started a GoFundMe fundraiser for a memorial scholarship for an aspiring African-American physician. Foronjy says Mahoney died with colleagues by his bedside. ""I was able to hold his hand, tell him how much I loved him, how much everybody loved him,"" he says.

"Annie Glenn, the widow of astronaut and Sen. John Glenn and a communication disorders advocate, died Tuesday at age 100, per the AP. Glenn died of COVID-19 complications at a nursing home near St. Paul, Minn., said a rep for the Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State. At the time of John Glenn's death in 2016, the pair who met as children had been married 73 years. She'd moved out of the apartment they shared in Columbus in recent years and gone to live with her daughter. Annie Glenn was thrust into the spotlight in 1962, when her husband became the first American to orbit Earth, but she shied away from media attention because of a severe stutter. Later, she underwent an intensive program at the Communications Research Institute at Virginia's Hollins College that gave her the skills to control her stutter and to speak in public.Her career in advocacy for those with communication disorders included service on the advisory boards of numerous child abuse and speech and hearing organizations. The Annie Glenn Award was created to honor individuals who overcome a communication disorder. Defense Secretary William Cohen honored Annie Glenn with the Department of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in 1998. He called her ""a hero in her own right"" and praised her for being ""a strong voice for children, speech and communications, and the disabled."" In 2009, Glenn received an honorary doctorate of public service from Ohio State, where she served as an adjunct professor of speech pathology in the Department of Speech and Hearing Science. The department bestows an Annie Glenn Leadership Award annually. She is survived by her two children, Lyn and David.

His family gave no details on his death, but his son released a statement Monday cited by the Hollywood Reporter: ""He was an incredibly kind and wonderful father. He had his family gathered around him when he passed. He was loved and will be very missed."" Osmond was 14 when he got the Leave It to Beaver gig in 1957; he was only supposed to appear in a single episode, but went on to star in 96 of the original series' episodes. Toward the end of the run, he was also serving in the US Army Reserves, per NBC News. He later continued to portray Haskell in films and shows in the 1980s and 1990s, with his own two sons playing Haskell's sons at one point.The character was so well-known for his habit of acting polite to adults, but being a bully when they weren't around, that psychologists termed such a personality the ""Eddie Haskell syndrome."" After the series' original run ended in 1963, Osmond found himself typecast: ""I would walk into a casting office and all they could see was Eddie. I couldn't get work to save my soul."" He ended up working as a helicopter pilot and studio propmaker before landing at the LAPD in 1970. He was shot multiple times on the job and was placed on disability in 1980 before retiring in 1988.

"A Massachusetts doctor has been arrested and charged with murder after his wife's body was found near their property Saturday night. CBS Boston reports that the remains of Kathleen McLean, 45, were discovered by cops not far from the Dover home she shared with her husband of five months, 58-year-old Ingolf Tuerk. Police had been investigating the disappearance of McLean, who'd last been seen on Thursday. Tuerk—a former Olympic decathlon athelete in his native Germany and once a ""star surgeon"" at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, per the Boston Globe—had been accused previously of physically abusing McLean, leading to McLean getting a restraining order against him in February. Among the incidents that led McLean to seek help, per the police report, was a December fight in which McLean says Tuerk slammed her head into their bed's headboard and tried to strangle her.She said in January he threw her to the ground with such force her shoes were knocked off. In a third incident, she said he went after her with scissors, cutting off a chunk of her hair and telling her, ""I'm the king of this castle ... you are only a guest."" However, in early May, McLean asked for the restraining order to be nixed, noting they'd reconciled and agreed to go to counseling. ""I feel safe and would like to bring my family back together with my husband,"" she said in a May 2 court affidavit. Tuerk's problems extended beyond his domestic life: He was terminated from St. Elizabeth's in February amid claims that he inappropriately billed Medicaid for services never rendered. Tuerk, who'd dated McLean for more than two years before they married, is the father of two teen boys, while McLean came into the marriage with three children of her own, per court records.

"The University of Utah student killed by an ex-boyfriend in 2018 tried to get help from police multiple times before her murder—but instead, an officer showed off explicit photos of Lauren McCluskey that the 21-year-old track athlete had entrusted to the department. Two police sources tell the Salt Lake Tribune that Miguel Deras saved the photos, which McCluskey submitted as evidence along with messages threatening to release them if she didn't pay $1,000, to his phone. Days before the man who was extorting McCluskey ultimately killed her, Deras showed the images to a co-worker and bragged that he could look at them every day, the sources say.The incident was not reported at the time, but the university now confirms it happened, after a push by the Tribune. Deras left the department last year and now works for a different police department, which has opened an internal affairs investigation in response to the article. The Tribune has been reporting on what it calls ""a string of missteps"" in the way McCluskey's concerns were handled by the police department, as well as others who have come forward to say that their reports of sexual crimes or domestic violence were mishandled by the campus police. Little was done to investigate McCluskey's concerns, which she first reported 10 days before her murder, and nothing was done when, on the morning of her death, she reported to police that her ex was trying to lure her out of her dorm.

"The coronavirus pandemic has pushed troubled department store chain JCPenney into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, per the AP. It's the fourth major retailer to meet that fate. As part of its reorganization, the 118-year-old company said late Friday it will be closing some of its stores and will disclose details and timing in the coming weeks. The company operates 850 stores and it has nearly 90,000 workers. It said that it received $900 million in financing to help it operate during the restructuring. JCPenney joins luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, and Stage Stores in filing for bankruptcy reorganization. Plenty of other retailers are expected to follow. Many experts are pessimistic about JCPenney's survival even as it sheds its debt and shrinks the number of its stores.Its fashion and home offerings haven't stood out for years.

""Penney offers no reason to shop there compared to its competitors, whether it's Macy’s or TJ Maxx or Walmart. How are they going to survive?""

The monthly decline in April nearly doubled the previous record drop of 8.3%—set just one month earlier. “It’s like a hurricane came and leveled the entire economy, and now we’re trying to get it back up and running,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist for the consultancy Maria Fiorini Ramirez. The sharpest declines from March to April were at clothing, electronics, and furniture stores.While online sales have risen amid the outbreak, that didn't make up for the general retail misery. Auto dealers suffered a monthly drop of 13%. Furniture stores absorbed a 59% plunge. Electronics and appliance stores were down over 60%. Retailers that sell building materials posted a drop of roughly 3%. After panic buying in March, grocery sales fell 13%. Clothing-store sales tumbled 79%, department stores 29%. Restaurants, some of which are already starting to close permanently, endured a nearly 30% decline despite shifting aggressively to takeout and delivery orders. More bad news Friday: American industry recorded the biggest drop on record last month as factories, mines, and utilities were all battered by the pandemic as well. The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index plunged a record 11.2% in April, per the AP.(Read more industrial stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/290957/retail-sales-have-never-fallen-this-much.html

"Cassandra Callender, who was forced by Connecticut courts as a teenager to undergo chemotherapy for cancer, has died after a five-year battle with the disease, her mother said Thursday. She was 22, the AP reports. Callender, of Windsor Locks, died Tuesday at home, where she had been in hospice care for four months, Jackie Fortin said. “The cancer never went away,” Fortin said. “They said they saved her life. They lied. She suffered for five years. It was horrific. If you did that to your dog, you’d get arrested.” A judge in 2015 ordered Callender, known as “Cassandra C.” during her legal fight, to undergo chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. She had refused treatment, saying she didn’t want to poison her body. She and her mother had missed several appointments, and doctors notified the state Department of Children and Families, which stepped in, according to court documents.A juvenile court judge removed Callender, who was 17 at the time, from her home and placed her under guard in the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. Her case went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled in January 2015 that the department wasn’t violating her rights. Doctors eventually implanted a port in Callender against her will to administer treatment, Fortin said. She lived at the hospital for six months. In 2016, Callender disclosed that a mass had been found on her lungs and that she would undergo alternative treatments. At that point an adult and able to make her own decisions, Callender eventually agreed to more chemo, immunotherapy, and other treatments, but the cancer spread, Fortin said. “Some things work, some things don't. Nothing always works. Neither is a guarantee,"" she said. “That was the point we were trying to make all along. It should have been her choice.” Callender leaves behind 19-month-old twin sons.(Read more obituary stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/290937/forced-to-undergo-chemo-at-17-she-died-at-22.html

"Two giant pandas scheduled to stay in Canada for three more years are instead headed back to China. Because of the pandemic shutdown, the CBC reports, the Calgary Zoo said it's having problems getting shipments of imported bamboo. ""This is too much stress on my team and on the pandas,"" said Clément Lanthier, head of the zoo. ""Can you imagine not having bamboo for a few days?"" The zoo needs deliveries of fresh bamboo twice a week from China, he said, which hasn't been possible because of air service cutbacks. The zoo struggled find a quality replacement for Er Shun and Da Mao. ""They don't like the bamboo they get,"" Lanthier said. ""They get fewer bamboo. The bamboo's too dry."" The pandas refused to eat bamboo brought from the US, per the Calgary Herald.Because the pandas are so selective about the bamboo they eat, the zoo needs large quantities. ""I could go on and on about the problems we have encountered moving bamboo from China, the United States, and elsewhere in Canada to Calgary,” Lanthier said. “It’s been very difficult."" Fear of a second wave of COVID-19 striking also affected the decision. The zoo, which has hosted the pair since 2018, is asking Canada and China to hurry the permits needed to send the pandas back. ""There is no time for politics or delay,"" Lanthier said. ""The welfare of the animals are at risk."" The zoo is closed during the pandemic, but the pandas have been a big draw. The zoo's PandaCam has been turned off while the pandas are prepared for their trip, per the zoo's website.

"Chickens aren't the only animals getting gassed amid the coronavirus pandemic. As the New York Times reports, American pork producers are killing and disposing of hundreds of thousands of pigs ""without processing them into food."" Closures of meatpacking plants mean there's a backlog of pigs waiting for slaughter. And farmers say there isn't enough space to house them or money to feed them. While cattle roam pastures, pigs are raised in temperature-controlled buildings and have an expected lifespan of six months, at which point they're slaughtered to make room for a new generation, per Reuters. Now there's nowhere for them to go. And if they keep eating, they'll reaching a weight unsafe for handling in meatpacking plants. Even with farmers trying to slow the growth, Iowa's backlog is expected to top 600,000 pigs over the next six weeks, per the Times.An estimated 90,000 pigs have already been killed in Minnesota. One farmer used carbon dioxide; another shot 3,000 pigs in the head—a daylong task. Reuters describes another injecting pregnant sows to cause abortions. The economic losses are huge—up to $390,000 per day, per the Times—but there's mental anguish, too. ""There are farmers who cannot finish their sentences when they talk about what they have to do,"" one pig farmer says. ""There will be suicides in rural America."" Thirteen senators from both sides of the aisle are now asking congressional leaders to help out.

"The death toll in Tuesday's attack on an Afghan hospital's maternity ward has climbed to 24, while deaths from a later attack on a funeral have risen to 32, per the BBC. The terror began around 10am with blasts and gunfire heard at the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital in Kabul. Three people, reportedly disguised as police officers, killed babies, mothers, medical workers, and a police officer, reports the New York Times. One dead mother was cradling her living newborn; others were found under beds. The attackers were eventually killed by security personnel. The government afterward blamed the Taliban, but the group denied responsibility for the attack. It was similar to others carried out by the Islamic State, per the BBC, which notes three high-profile ISIS members were arrested in Kabul on Monday.An Afghan group affiliated with the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the violence that followed in Nangarhar, some 125 miles to the east, per the Times. A suicide bomber detonated a device halfway through a funeral for a police commander. Some 133 people were injured in the blast, per the BBC. Even the body of the police commander was ""riddled with shrapnel,"" reports the Times. ""Any attack on innocents is unforgivable, but to attack infants and women in labor in the sanctuary of a hospital is an act of sheer evil,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday, per Fox News.

"Militants stormed a maternity hospital Tuesday in the western part of Kabul, Afghanistan, setting off an hourslong shootout with police and killing 14 people, including two newborn babies, their mothers, and nurses, Afghan officials say. The AP reports that while the battle was underway, Afghan security forces struggled to evacuate the facility, carrying out babies and frantic young mothers, per images shared by the Interior Ministry. Soon after the attack started, black smoke rose into the sky over the hospital in Dashti Barchi, a mostly Shiite neighborhood that has been the site of many past attacks by Islamic State militants. Interior Ministry spokesman Tareq Arian said more than 100 women and babies were evacuated from the building before it was over, including three foreign nationals. Arian said 15 others, including women, men, and children, were wounded in the attack.It was unclear why the 100-bed hospital was targeted—an attack Arian said was an ""act against humanity and a war crime."" No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Kabul, where both the Taliban and ISIS frequently target Afghan military and security forces, as well as civilians. The Taliban denied they were involved. ""The forces are trying to eliminate the terrorists and bring the situation under control,"" said Arian while the battle was ongoing. A few hours after the attack started, the ministry released a statement saying all three attackers were dead. The foreign ministry of neighboring Pakistan said both that attack and one Tuesday on a funeral in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, in which 24 were killed and 68 wounded, ""are particularly despicable as they take place in the holy month of Ramadan and at a time when Afghanistan is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.""(Read more Kabul stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/290797/at-afghan-maternity-clinic-a-particularly-despicable-act.html

"When a COVID-19 patient on her ward stopped breathing, nurse Celia Marcos rushed into his room to help the ""code blue"" patient without stopping to try to obtain a scarce N95 face mask. She died of the disease 14 days later in the hospital where she worked for more than 16 years, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. Colleagues at the hospital tell the Los Angeles Times that while the 61-year-old was undoubtedly selfless, she might not have died if the hospital had provided the appropriate personal protective equipment. ""The hospital wasn’t giving us appropriate PPE—the N95s were locked,"" one nurse says. ""It’s just too painful for everybody, what happened to her."" Colleagues say Marcos, who oversaw a ward that took coronavirus patients when the COVID-19 units were full, was not given an N95 mask at the start of her shift.Marcos, with only a regular surgical mask for protection, stayed in the patient's room for around 30 minutes. She began feeling ill three days later. Her union has filed a complaint with state authorities, saying her death was the result of inadequate protective gear provided to staff.

"Comedian Jerry Stiller, the father of Ben Stiller who played the high-strung Frank Costanza on Seinfeld, has died at 92, reports USA Today. Ben Stiller announced the news on Twitter, saying his dad died of natural causes. ""He was a great dad and grandfather, and the most dedicated husband to Anne for about 62 years. He will be greatly missed,"" wrote Ben Stiller. ""Love you Dad."" The late Anne Meara was his comedy sidekick for years. Per the AP, Jerry Stiller was a multi-talented performer who appeared in an assortment of movies, playing Walter Matthau’s police sidekick in the thriller The Taking of Pelham One Two Three and Divine’s husband Wilbur Turnblad in John Waters’ twisted comedy, Hairspray. He also wrote an autobiography, Married to Laughter, about his 50-plus year marriage to soul mate and comedic cohort Meara, who died in 2015.And his myriad television spots included everything from Murder, She Wrote to Law & Order—along with 36 appearances alongside Meara on The Ed Sullivan Show. Stiller, although a supporting player on Seinfeld, created some of the show’s most enduring moments: co-creator and model for the “bro,” a brassiere for men; a Korean War cook who inflicted food poisoning on his entire unit; an ever-simmering salesman controlling his explosive temper with the shouted mantra, “Serenity now!” Stiller earned an 1997 Emmy nomination for his indelible Seinfeld performance. He was initially told to play the role of Frank Costanza, father of George, as a milquetoast husband with an overbearing wife, played by Estelle Harris. But the character wasn’t working—until Stiller suggested his reincarnation as an over-the-top crank who matched his wife scream for scream.

Minson added that the family is not releasing the cause of death. Born Richard Penniman, Little Richard was one of rock 'n' roll’s founding fathers who helped shatter the color line on the music charts, joining Chuck Berry and Fats Domino in bringing what was once called ""race music"" into the mainstream.Richard’s hyperkinetic piano playing, coupled with his howling vocals and hairdo, made him an implausible sensation—a gay, black man celebrated across America during the buttoned-down Eisenhower era. He sold more than 30 million records worldwide, and his influence on other musicians was equally staggering, from the Beatles and Otis Redding to Creedence Clearwater Revival and David Bowie. In his personal life, he wavered between raunch and religion, alternately embracing the Good Book and outrageous behavior. ""Little Richard? That’s rock ‘n’ roll,"" Neil Young once said. ""Little Richard was great on every record.""

Siegfried & Roy were an institution in Las Vegas, where their magic and artistry consistently attracted sellout crowds. The pair performed six shows a week, 44 weeks per year. ""Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend,"" Siegfried Fischbacher, who had been Horn's business and domestic partner, said in a statement, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.""The German-born pair met on a cruise in 1957; Horn was a waiter, Fischbacher a steward. They started building a theater and nightclub act centered on magic and exotic animals and gained publicity after Princess Grace saw them at a 1966 show in Monte Carlo, Monaco, and gave them a rave review. They arrived in Sin City in 1967 as a specialty act at the Tropicana. They became the main act at the Frontier Hotel in the early '80s and moved on to the Mirage hotel-casino about a decade later, where they signed lifetime contracts. Horn was critically injured in 2003 by one of the act’s white tigers. He was attacked by the tiger during the duo’s act at the Mirage. He had severe neck injuries and later had a stroke.

"Britain now has Europe's highest official coronavirus death toll after the latest round of daily figures Tuesday showed it overtaking Italy. Only the United States has recorded more virus-related deaths. The British government said another 693 people died in hospitals, nursing homes, and other settings after testing positive for COVID-19, taking the total to 29,427—above Italy's 29,315. The tallies are likely underestimates because they do not include suspected coronavirus deaths. Taking into account countries’ populations, the U.K.’s per capita death rate is below those in Italy, Spain, and Belgium. And the US is below them all even though it has the highest number of registered COVID-19 deaths with more than 70,000, the AP reports.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the number of deaths was a “massive tragedy,” but added that it was too soon to make reliable international comparisons, partly because of apparent differences in the way countries report deaths. ""I don’t think we’ll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over and particularly until we’ve got comprehensive international data on all-cause mortality,"" he said. A lockdown has been in place since March 23, but government advisers have voiced worries about the number of new cases still being recorded. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has recovered from COVID-19 himself, has warned of a second spike in the epidemic and that the UK is at the moment of “maximum risk.”(Read more coronavirus stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/290516/uk-now-has-the-most-virus-deaths-in-europe.html

"Airlines are not doing well amid the coronavirus pandemic—and in a memo recently sent to staffers, United Airlines' COO is urging employees to consider voluntarily separating from the company, CNN reports. ""You may want to seriously consider if you're in a position to take a voluntary separation,"" Greg Hart wrote. ""You, alone, can decide if a [Voluntary Separation Program] works for you and your family."" Hart warned that the company will need to ""right-size"" its workforce. ""Travel demand is essentially zero for the foreseeable future,"" a company spokesperson recently said.The airline was forced to cut its May and June schedule by 90% of what was originally planned. A federal assistance package prevents it from laying anyone off for six months, but it plans to start letting staff go as of Oct. 1, and will give those affected notice sometime in July. The memo urged employees to consider voluntarily separating before that comes to pass. Anyone who does so will keep travel and medical benefits for an extended period of time, and will also receive ""some continuation of pay,"" an airline VP said in the memo, per the Chicago Tribune. Those who are laid off without taking the voluntary separation package will not receive severance. Reuters reports the airline plans to cut 30% of management in October.

"An Illinois man who spent years making crosses and bringing them to the sites of mass shootings and other disasters around the US died Monday. The death of Greg Zanis, announced by his daughter, Susie Zanis, was expected after a recent announcement that he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer and did not have long to live. On Friday, the 69-year-old Zanis greeted supporters who drove by his Aurora home as part of a drive-by procession and living visitation that was organized by his daughter. Zanis established Crosses for Losses as a tribute to his father-in-law, who was fatally shot in 1996. Since then, he set up crosses near the mass shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook, and Parkland, and drove 2,000 miles to install crosses in Las Vegas, reports the AP.He also set up crosses in places where the deaths did not receive nearly as much publicity, such as the spot in New Mexico where six children died in a bus accident. Just last year, he made crosses for his hometown after a warehouse worker opened fire, killing five of his co-workers before he was killed during a shootout with police. In December, after making and delivering 27,000 crosses, he announced he was retiring. ""I had a breaking point in El Paso,"" he said, referring to the mass shooting outside of a Walmart there. ""I hadn't slept for two days, it was 106 degrees and I collapsed from the pressure when I heard there were two more victims of the mass shooting."" On Aurora's Facebook page, Mayor Richard Irvin paid tribute to Zanis. ""Greg Zanis was a giant among men.

"Country singer Cady Groves has died in Nashville at age 30, reports Variety. For those unfamiliar, one of her bigger hits was the 2011 song ""This Little Girl,"" and it shows why USA Today categorizes her as a ""pop and country"" singer rather than country alone. Groves' Big Hassle label says she seems to have died of natural causes, making a point to say that ""foul play and self-harm have both been ruled out by the coroner."" Her family reiterated that, asking that ""fans refrain from speculation."" That speculation is the apparent result of some social media posts Groves made last month amid the coronavirus lockdown. ""Some days my mental health is AWFUL,"" she wrote on April 15. ""I feel completely alone and scared and far from everyone I love and all I can do is keep myself busy and push through.""Brother Cody Groves posted that a ""cluster of twisted information"" has surfaced about his sister, which he wanted to put to rest. ""She had some medical problems last fall and our best guess at this point until further testing is complete is that they had resurfaced."" He said his sister was happy and excited about the release of an upcoming album. Groves was an Oklahoma native, and NBC News reports that she's the third sibling in the family to die young. A brother died at 28 in 2014, about seven years after another brother died at the same age. Both had struggled with prescription drug addictions. ""Rest In Peace little sis,'' wrote Cody Groves.

"Police seized 90 dogs from a no-kill animal shelter in Kentucky due to its allegedly poor conditions, reports the AP, and charged its owner after dead cats and dogs were found in the facility's freezer. The dogs were taken Saturday because of ""poor living conditions"" at the Trixie Foundation's shelter, Kentucky State Police said in a release. The shelter's website advertises itself as an ""Eden"" for animals and the ""best kept secret in animal welfare."" Melissa Bowman, president of Kentuckians Vote for Animals, accompanied police during the raid. She told the Lexington Herald-Leader the dogs suffered ""medical neglect"" and that some were found with tumors. Other dogs had to be tranquilized before leaving the shelter, and one dog was euthanized at the facility. Police obtained a search warrant after receiving complaints about the shelter in April, the Herald-Leader reported.Shelter owner Randy Skaggs, who was scheduled to stand trial this June on misdemeanor animal cruelty charges from 2018, said he provides medical care when the animals need it. He said he neglected to bury the seven cats and five dogs found in the freezer because of a high workload. ""I've not intentionally done anything except try to help these animals,"" Skaggs said. ""Everyone makes mistakes, and I've made plenty of them."" Skaggs blames critics of his no-euthanization policy with influencing this latest raid to pressure him to plead guilty to the earlier charges. Skaggs, 68, now faces 12 additional counts, of improper disposal. He wasn't arrested, and he said he intends to fight all the charges. He tells the Herald-Leader that he's contacted the ACLU.

"Before her double-lung transplant, Joanne Mellady could barely put on a shirt without losing her breath. Afterward, she barely stopped moving. Mellady, who died of the coronavirus in March, had a bucket list that made her family blush, the AP reports. Since getting her transplant in 2007, the widow and former technology consultant from the town of Washington, NH, traveled in her RV up and down the East Coast and made trips to Alaska and the Grand Canyon. Mellady, 67, transformed herself from a shy person dependent on oxygen around the clock to a vivacious risk taker willing to try almost anything. Hang gliding, skiing, skateboarding, and kayaking were among the thrills she took on.Before her death, Mellady was talking of a return visit to Alaska this summer and of participating again in the Transplant Games (now postponed). She won medals in bocce, bowling, and swimming in past competitions and was hoping to compete in the golf event. For much of her earlier life in Massachusetts, Mellady was hobbled by a mysterious lung condition. Then, in her late 30s, she tested positive for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder. The inherited condition predisposes people to lung conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the emphysema Mellady developed before her transplant. For the 13 years after her transplant, Mellady served as an inspiration for other patients about to undergo similar transplants, a source of support for their relatives and a wealth of information for doctors studying her condition.

"Dexter Rentz Jr. had tied a Florida state record with five interceptions in one game. He had signed with the University of Louisville after getting 22 other scholarship offers. He had a future, until Saturday night—when police say the 18-year-old cornerback/slot receiver from Florida died in a hail of bullets, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

"The Navajo are battling America's third-highest coronavirus infection rate after New York and New Jersey as they scramble to treat the sick—and it's clearly an uphill battle, NPR reports. Their challenges include lack of hospital space, lack of nursing, lack of equipment, and facilities that simply aren't designed for respiratory care. ""We basically changed our hospital from an acute care hospital and an ambulatory care clinic to one that could take care of respiratory care patients,"" Diana Hu, a doctor at a reservation hospital, tells NBC News. ""And that transition happened over a period of about seven days."" The situation forces them to fly patients to Albuquerque, Flagstaff, and Phoenix as strike teams try to help in communities, but endemic Najavo problems aren't helping.Officials say the lack of clean, running water makes it hard to promote hand-washing, and contact-tracing can be tough when people live hours apart or have no phone—reminders that American tribes have long lacked funding for essential infrastructure. ""We are United States citizens but we're not treated like that,"" says Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez. ""You can hear the frustration, the tone of my voice. We once again have been forgotten by our own government."" Apropos, the Navajo have joined 10 tribes in suing the federal government, saying their combined $8 billion share of $2 trillion in relief money is far too low. The Navajo—who number roughly 175,000 across Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico—had 1,540 coronavirus cases and 58 deaths as of Friday, the AP reports.

On Monday, however, the 4-month-old daughter of New York City firefighter Jerel La Santa and his wife, Lindsey, succumbed to COVID-19, just hours after it appeared she'd turned a corner, per the Hill. ""She was very feisty. She kept us on our toes,"" her grandmother, Wanda La Santa, tells NBC News of her first grandchild, who'd been in the hospital since March 21 after developing a fever. Although Jay-Natalie's initial test for the virus came back negative, she wasn't getting better, and so a week later another test was administered, which came back positive. The family has no idea how she got sick, Wanda La Santa says. Although Jay-Natalie was awake for her first two weeks or so in the hospital, she had a heart condition, so doctors eventually decided to put her in a medically induced coma.A week or so after that, Wanda La Santa says, the fever went away, Jay-Natalie's lungs began clearing up, and doctors who met with the family on Monday believed she was on her way to recovery. Then, ""in a matter of minutes ... everything just started going south,"" Wanda La Santa says. Jay-Natalie died a week before she turned 5 months old. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the La Santa family during this tragic time,"" an FDNY rep says in a statement to CNN. A GoFundMe for the La Santas, which raised more than $41,000 for the family, says Jay-Natalie was ""a little person with a big personality"" who loved music and being cuddled.

"A US Air Force member has been charged with the murder of a Mennonite woman who disappeared from her New Mexico community in January, a month before her body was found in Arizona. Airman Mark Gooch, 21, was arrested at the Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Arizona, on Tuesday and charged with the murder of Sasha Krause, in addition to kidnapping and theft. ""I can assure you, we have our man,"" said Shane Ferrari of New Mexico's San Juan County Sheriff's Office, per NBC News. He suggested authorities would pursue the death penalty.

"Police in Victoria, Australia, are in mourning after what the state's police chief says is the biggest loss of life in the state's history. Four officers were killed on a freeway in Melbourne Wednesday when a refrigerated poultry truck slammed into them while they were impounding a Porsche 911 that had been stopped for speeding, the BBC reports. Police say the Porsche driver, apparently uninjured, fled the scene on foot after the officers were killed and posted graphic images of the crash on social media after fleeing. He was located by police and questioned Thursday morning. The truck driver was hospitalized after having a medical episode at the scene and will be tested for drugs and alcohol, reports the AP.Police say the Porsche driver, identified as 41-year-old Richard Pusey, tested positive for an illicit drug after being pulled over; the crash happened soon after two officers arrived to help impound his car. The three men and one woman killed in the crash included a recent police academy graduate who had started working with highway police a day earlier, the Guardian reports. Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said Pusey's alleged actions were disgusting, reports the Brisbane Times. ""Today, when I'm spending time with the family members of those deceased officers, I can tell you it will absolutely disgust them.

"From the ages of 16 to 60, William Garrison spent his day inside a Michigan prison. It was all leading up to May 6, when the convicted murderer who repented ""over and over again"" for the crime of killing a 50-year-old man during a 1976 robbery was set to walk out a changed man, his sister Yolanda Peterson tells ABC News. But on April 13 Garrison was pronounced dead at Lenox Township's Macomb Correctional Facility; a postmortem test verified he had COVID-19. ""His bunkmate said that he was gasping for air and he called out for help,"" Chris Gautz of the Michigan Department of Corrections tells ABC. The death is even more tragic considering Garrison was granted early parole in February, before the current pandemic took hold.But Garrison refused to leave then, saying he wanted to finish his sentence, which was to wrap up in September, so he could ""walk out a completely free man,"" says Gautz, rather than have to report to a parole officer. Garrison did agree to be released in May amid concerns about the spread of the virus in prisons. The Detroit Free Press reports the tuberculosis he suffered as an infant led to him having a lung removed, which put him at greater risk. But it was too late. ""We're heartbroken because he was coming home"" and ""wanted to work as an advocate for people in jail,"" says Peterson.

"A Minnesota contract egg farmer says his livelihood has been erased along with 61,000 chickens owing to a drop in demand triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Kerry Mergen and his wife, Barb, produced 4,500 dozen eggs per day, which were turned into fluid egg and sent to food service companies across North America, reports the Minneapolis Star Tribune. They received about $700 daily from Daybreak Foods, which owned the chickens and covered the cost of feed. But as demand suddenly dropped, Daybreak chose to end its contract with the Mergens months early. And on April 9, a crew arrived at the farm near Albany. Workers culled the still productive flock using carbon dioxide, then hauled away the carcasses to be turned into dog food.""The longer I was there, the more disgusted and disappointed I was knowing that I'm not going to see anything put back in my checkbook again,"" says Mergen, who adds he doesn't qualify for unemployment insurance and is on a waitlist for federal aid. ""When they euthanized the birds, that was our paycheck euthanized,"" says Barb. She notes the couple would need a large loan to buy their own chickens and more money to pay for equipment to grade eggs for the retail market. There, demand for eggs is rising, along with prices, per the Wall Street Journal. Demand for fluid egg, however, is declining along with food-service orders—a fact Cargill cited last week in temporarily shutting its fluid egg plant in Big Lake, Minn., where many of the Mergens' eggs were sent.

But her lengthy piece for Wired isn't as much about how Holloway shaped Cloudflare, but about his strange and long-unexplained descent that came next. The changes to Holloway's personality were gradual: He became pricklier. His interest in what he was working on waned; he'd play games on his phone during meetings. And he slept. A lot, including during three days of a family trip to Paris.He did have two medical issues: migraines and a lifelong issue with his aortic valve that necessitated a January 2015 surgery. He took months off work; the sleepiness increased; his personality got rougher. By the summer of 2016, his two co-founders decided he had to go, and he agreed. But nothing improved. He slept all the time, demonstrated no interest in his newborn son, and watched Home Alone over and over. It wasn't until March 2017 that the MRI that no one suspected he needed reveal something amiss: atrophy in Holloway's brain. Holloway was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a rare disease that doesn't initially impact memory but does alter behavior.

"Germany's Werneck Brewery has survived world wars, economic crises, and decades of declining beer consumption. But after 400 years it has finally met a fatal challenge: the coronavirus. The brewery, which the AP reports traces its history to 1617 and has been owned by the same family since 1861, is closing for good, taking with it 15 full-time jobs and more part-time positions. Also gone is a chunk of local history and tradition in Werneck, a town of 10,000 in the brewery-rich state of Bavaria. German brewers fear its demise is the leading edge of more closures as the virus outbreak threatens the existence of the country's many local producers of the national beverage—community institutions, often family owned for generations, whose buildings and affiliated taverns are regional landmarks in a country where the hometown brew is a sentimental favorite despite national competition.Hardest hit are smaller breweries that like Werneck that depend on supplying kegs to local taverns and events such as local festivals. Retail sales are providing some support as people drink at home. Breweries are trying things like drive-through sales and even shipping beer and glasses to customers so they can join an online tasting. Family member and brewery manager Christine Lang said the decision to close came with “many tears.” The beer market was already hard fought with tough price competition, she said. Then came the virus, and the restaurants the brewery depended on were suddenly closed. The head of the German Brewers Association said that “many breweries will not survive this crisis, that is already becoming clear.” For Lang something irreplaceable has been lost. “My family and I will miss it very much. The brewery has been ... part of every dinner table conversation all our lives. We will be missing part of our identity, and in a way the region will too.”(Read more coronavirus stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/289760/now-the-virus-is-taking-our-beer.html

"Teen twins gunned down this week are being mourned in their California community, and their mother's ex-boyfriend has been arrested and charged in their deaths. Caira and Leah Christopher—15-year-old sophomores at Helix Charter High School in La Mesa, described by a relative as ""always smiling and always happy,"" per the San Diego Union-Tribune—were killed in their Lemon Grove residence during a domestic violence incident, cops say. Per KGTV, San Diego County Sheriff's deputies were called to the home before noon Wednesday, where they found an anguished Joann Hoyt outside. ""My twin daughters, who are 15, are dead in the house,"" she told them. The deceased girls were found inside the home. Police say they located Dwayne Edward Groves Jr., 38, nearby around 2:30pm. He's been charged with murder, attempted murder, and assault with a deadly weapon.Hoyt told OnScene.TV that she and Groves had split a week or so earlier, but that she'd agreed to let him stop by on Easter, as he's the father of her younger kids. ""Then today he said he figured it all out,"" she said. ""He finally knows what he needs to do. And he showed up at the house and shot my back window out."" Hoyt added one of the twins tried to close the door on Groves, but he kicked it open and shot the girl in the head, then ""went after my other three older kids."" Her son, in his early 20s, was also shot but survived, with non-life-threatening injuries, a sheriff's department rep says, per CSN. A GoFundMe has been set up for the twins' family to help pay for funeral expenses. Groves—who has a lengthy rap sheet, with records showing felony arrests for carrying a loaded firearm and being a felon with a firearm, among others—is being held without bail until his arraignment on May 1.

"A gruesome discovery was made Monday at one of New Jersey's largest licensed nursing homes, after a tip came in to police that a body was being stored in a shed. When Andover cops showed up at Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I and II, there was no body in the shed, but there were 17 piled up inside the facility's four-person morgue. ""They were just overwhelmed by the amount of people who were expiring,"" says Police Chief Eric Danielson, who tells CNN the facility was likely ""short-staffed."" A funeral home will be picking up four of the bodies; the other 13 have been sent to a refrigerated truck at a local hospital. These deaths are just part of the 68 recently logged at the nursing home, 26 of which were from COVID-19; the other causes of death aren't clear. Meanwhile, 76 patients there have the virus, as well as 41 workers.Conditions at the facility—which had poor ratings and multiple violations even before the pandemic, per Newsweek—as well as a lack of protective personal equipment and communications from higher-ups, spurred complaints as well; police also visited the facility on Sunday, the New Jersey Herald reports.

"With schools and restaurants closed during the coronavirus pandemic, truck drivers afraid to transport product for fear of catching the virus, and exports slowing to a crawl, the dairy industry is taking a hit—and it's forcing farmers to trash their milk supply. ""We need you to start dumping your milk,"" an Illinois dairy farmer tells Reuters was the message to him from a Dairy Farmers of America rep. Dairy products, especially milk, are still in demand at supermarkets; there's often even a ration per customer. But panic buying has decreased in recent days, and that demand for dairy has dropped about ""12% to 15% across the entire United States,"" a DFA spokeswoman tells NBC News. And it's not only a demand issue: The supply chain itself has been upended, meaning dairy farmers simply can't get their perishable product to where it's got to go in time.Suppliers are also having trouble manufacturing or repackaging milk for retail instead of for wholesale (which is how schools, hotels, and restaurants purchase it)—and so milk cooperatives are instructing members to pour out thousands of gallons a day. ""You can't shut down cows. You can't turn them off like a faucet,"" a Wisconsin dairy farmer tells NBC. ""Just to see it literally going down the drain—it's devastating."" The International Dairy Foods Association tells the New York Times that 5% or so of the nation's milk is being thrown out, and that will jump to two times that much if the US is shut down for a few more months. A Texas farmer even asked if he could donate his milk supply, but there aren't available processing plants. It's ""a kick in the gut,"" he tells WFAA.

"A new study about a relentless pathogen hitting olive trees in Europe has bleak projections for the industry, with the disease on track to drive up the price of olive oil in supermarkets around the world. The disease is known formally as olive quick decline syndrome, but more commonly as ""olive leprosy,"" reports the Guardian. It was first detected in Italy in 2013, and it has now spread to an estimated 17% of that nation's olive-producing areas. But the disease also has a foothold in nations including Spain, Greece, Portugal, and France. The disease is spread by insects—specifically by something called a spittlebug—and it has no cure, per the BBC. In a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers looked at a 50-year projection for Italy, Spain, and Greece and estimated damages north of $21 billion if the pathogen runs unchecked.The problem, though, is that remedies are expensive and of the long-range variety. Researchers say farmers need to remove not only infected trees but seemingly healthy ones nearby to create a buffer zone. And because the pathogen has no cure, the best long-range option may be to replace current trees with disease-resistant varieties, once developed. Taking such measures would significantly reduce the 50-year economic toll, say researchers, but in any scenario they expect supplies to diminish and olive oil prices to rise. Also, ""we did not account for the cultural heritage value associated with these trees,"" says researcher Kevin Schneider of Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Farmers may be working on the same groves once tended by their grandparents. ""So how do you put an economic number on the loss of something like this?""

"Think remote corners of the Amazon are safe from infection? Sadly, not so.

The boy experienced symptoms including fever and shortness of breath, per Fox News, and was placed in ICU at Roraima General Hospital in Boa Vista on April 3. The cause of death wasn't released, but reports suggest illegal gold miners could be responsible for Alvanei's infection.

"More than 5,000 people have died in New York City from the coronavirus, and it looks like some of them may be headed to what the New York Daily News calls the ""Island of the Dead."" Hart Island, located off the Bronx and run by the Department of Corrections, is where the city sends unclaimed bodies or those who can't afford funerals to be buried. Over the past few weeks, there's been a significant spike in burials there—but not of COVID-19 patients, at least not yet, per Mayor Bill de Blasio's office. Instead, city morgues and mortuaries are clearing out other bodies to make way for the tens of thousands of New Yorkers expected to perish during the pandemic. But ""it is likely that people who have passed away from [coronavirus] ... will be buried on the island in the coming days,"" de Blasio spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein tells CNN.Before the pandemic hit, there were about 25 bodies buried on the island per week; during the week of March 30, however, there were 125 burials. Per the BBC, drone footage emerged this week showing workers in hazmat suits on the island climbing in and out of a pit containing stacked coffins. Goldstein tells CNN that burials there are typically patients who've remained unclaimed at the morgue for anywhere from one month to two months. Due to recent circumstances, however, she notes that the medical examiner's rules have been modified so that any bodies not claimed after two weeks will be sent there for burial. Hart Island has served as one of the city's public cemeteries for 150 years, with more than 1 million people buried there—including thousands who died during the AIDS epidemic in the '80s.

"If you've spent any time at all with Mad Magazine over the years, you've been entertained by Mort Drucker. But Thursday brings bad news: The legendary cartoonist has died at age 91 at his home in Woodbury, New York, reports the New York Times. No cause of death was given, and it was unclear whether it was related to the coronavirus. Drucker joined Mad in 1956 and gained particular renown in the subsequent decades for his parodies of movies and TV shows. ""I think I've drawn almost everyone in Hollywood,"" he once told the Times. In time, big stars came to cherish being immortalized by Drucker.For example, Jerry Seinfeld said a cover drawn by Drucker in which Seinfeld says, ""Helloooo Neuman"" to magazine mascot Alfred E.

George Lucas once said Drucker deserved a ""special Oscar"" for his Star Wars illustrations and dubbed him the ""Leonardo da Vinci of satire,"" notes Newsweek.

"By age 7, Charlotte Figi had inspired a movement and changed the way CBD is used for medicinal purposes. On Tuesday, at age 13, she died—likely as a result of the coronavirus. As the Colorado Sun reports, Charlotte's mom, Paige, had been posting on Facebook for weeks about a serious illness that had hit their family. Though symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties, the family didn't meet the criteria to get tested for COVID-19, but as Charlotte's symptoms worsened, she was ultimately admitted to the hospital on April 3. A test for the illness came back negative (though the Sun notes it is known to produce false negatives), but she was treated on a floor for COVID-19 patients using COVID-19 protocols. She seemed to improve and was discharged Sunday, but on Tuesday suffered a seizure, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest, returned to the hospital as a ""likely COVID-19 case,"" and didn't make it.Charlotte started having seizures at 3 months old and was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy. She was not expected to survive past age 8, CNN reports. Pharmaceutical treatments didn't work, and she struggled to walk, talk, and feed herself by age 5. Then her parents heard about CBD oil, which is made from the non-psychoactive compound in cannabis, being used to treat seizures in a California child. They found a Colorado Springs medical pot dispensary willing to help, and on CBD oil, Charlotte thrived. Her parents ultimately weaned her off her anti-epileptic pharmaceutical drugs, and she started playing, walking, and feeding herself. The dispensary's oil was renamed ""Charlotte's Web"" for her, and her story changed the public perception of cannabis, helped change medical pot laws—and helped many other children with medical needs.

"Maryland police say the lifeless body of 8-year-old Gideon McKean was found Wednesday after days of searching the Chesapeake Bay, USA Today reports. The descendant of Robert F. Kennedy vanished last week when he and his mother, Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, went adrift in a canoe in the bay's choppy waters. Gideon was found in about 25 feet of water, roughly 2,000 feet from where his 40-year-old mother was found Monday. The pair were trying to retrieve a lost ball in a cove near the home where they were staying close to Shady Side.""Gideon, like his mom, was a star athlete who loved soccer, golf, and running,"" said former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Maeve's mother, on Friday, per WBAL-TV. ""He took after his parents in the most extraordinary ways. He loved riddles, math, chess, and adventures.

"In a 10-day span, four members of the same Louisiana family were dead from the coronavirus. Antoinette Franklin, 86, of New Orleans, and her sons Herman Franklin Jr., 71; Timothy Franklin, 61; and Anthony Franklin Sr., 58, died between March 20 and 30. All tested positive for COVID-19, the New York Daily News reports, but other family members don't know how they got it. Louisiana has emerged as a coronavirus hot spot and had reported 16,284 confirmed cases and 582 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, NBC News reports.

"Grammy-winning singer-songwriter John Prine died Tuesday of COVID-19 complications, his family says. The 73-year-old folk-country artist was admired by such big-name colleagues as Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson, and, as Rolling Stone reports, he helped shape the Americana genre, whose current stars Jason Isbell and Brandi Carlile, among others, were also fans of his. Born in a Chicago suburb to the president of the local steelworkers' union and raised on the stars of the Grand Ole Opry, Prine started writing songs at a young age. After high school, he became a postal worker, an era during which he wrote many of his ""classics,"" per Rolling Stone. He was drafted into the army during the Vietnam War, though he ended up in Germany instead. Upon his return home, Roger Ebert discovered him performing at a Chicago club's open mic night.After Ebert's glowing review of that 1970 performance (which you can read in full here), Prine started selling out shows, including one attended by Kris Kristofferson and Paul Anka. They, too, were impressed, which ultimately led to Prine's deal with Atlantic Records. His self-titled debut album was released in 1971. Rolling Stone says he spent much of his career ""underground,"" with his songs covered and sung by such luminaries as Bonnie Raitt, Johnny Cash, George Strait, the Everly Brothers, Joan Baez, Carly Simon, and Bette Midler—but his 2018 album, his first one in 13 years featuring original material, was the highest debut of his career and led to some of the biggest shows he'd ever done (and that was after he beat cancer twice). Of his music, the New York Times says he ""chronicled the human condition in song,"" telling stories including those of of a drug-addicted war veteran, a lonely elderly couple, and a middle-aged woman stuck in a bad marriage.

"The parents of two kids killed in an Arizona flash flood in November have been hit with charges after those children, plus one of their young nieces, all drowned in the floodwaters. A spokesman for the Gila County Sheriff's Office confirmed to People that Daniel Rawlings was charged with three counts of involuntary manslaughter, as well as seven counts of child abuse. His wife, Lacey Rawlings, was also charged with seven counts of child abuse. Daniel Rawlings was said to have been behind the wheel Thanksgiving weekend of a military-style vehicle that allegedly drove around a barricade erected to keep people from using a crossing over the swollen Tonto Creek. The vehicle got caught up in the rushing waters, and while Daniel and Lacey Rawlings managed to escape the vehicle with two of their children and two of their nieces, three children were swept away, per KPHO.Those children were IDed as the Rawlingses' 5-year-old son, Colby; 6-year-old daughter, Willa; and 5-year-old niece, Austin. Although Daniel Rawlings said ""no comment"" when asked for one by KPHO, Bruce Griffen, Daniel Rawlings' attorney, tells the station his client is ""disappointed"" about the charges against him.

"Tom Dempsey, the kicker who made a 63-yard field goal that stood as the NFL record for more than 40 years, died Saturday of COVID-19. Dempsey, 73, lived in a New Orleans senior center, where he tested positive for the coronavirus in March, USA Today reports. At least 14 other people at the home have COVID-19, reports NOLA. Dempsey suffered from Alzheimer's disease and dementia in recent years. Born without toes on his right foot, which he kicked with, and missing part of his right hand, Dempsey played 11 years in the NFL with five teams. His career began when the Saints signed him as an undrafted free agent in 1969. The Pro Football Hall of Fame displays the small, flat shoe he kicked with, per Yahoo Sports.Dempsey entered Saints lore with a kick as time ran out against the Detroit Lions in 1970. His 63-yarder, which gave the Saints a 19-17 victory, was 6 yards beyond the record at the time, per Bleacher Report. The mark was equaled but not surpassed until Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos hit from 64 yards in 2013. The kick gave the city a rare reason to celebrate the Saints, and the party began immediately in the French Quarter. ""If you’re going to set a record, this is the town to do it in,"" Dempsey later told the Los Angeles Times. ""I didn't get home until about 7:30, 8 o’clock the next morning."" When he hit the kick, a teammate said it sounded ""like a cannon going off."" Dempsey later said he didn't realize he was setting a record.

"In Thailand, elephants are at risk of becoming indirect victims of the coronavirus pandemic. With tourism at a standstill, the country's estimated 2,000 captive elephants are at risk of starvation, the AFP reports. Owners say they can't afford the hundreds of pounds of food an elephant needs each day. ""If there is no support forthcoming to keep them safe, these elephants, some of whom are pregnant, will either starve to death or may be put on to the streets to beg,"" Lek Chailert, founder of the Save Elephant Foundation, tells the BBC. Elephants may also end up being sold to zoos or put to work in the illegal logging industry. Campaigners, who say it costs at least $30 a day to feed an elephant, have urged the Thai government to fund camps to ensure the animals survive the crisis.

"Jimmy Wynn, the diminutive Houston slugger whose monster shots in the 1960s and '70s earned him the popular nickname “The Toy Cannon,"" has died. He was 78. The Astros said the three-time All-Star outfielder died Thursday in Houston, per the AP, but did not provide further details. Just 5-foot-9, Wynn was packed with power. He hit more than 30 homers twice with Houston, including a career-high 37 in 1967 at the pitcher-friendly Astrodome. ""Jimmy’s success on the field helped build our franchise from its beginnings,"" the Astros said in a statement. ""After his retirement, his tireless work in the community impacted thousands of young people in Houston. Although he is no longer with us, his legacy will live on at Minute Maid Park, at the Astros Youth Academy and beyond."" At the time of his death, Wynn worked in the Astros' front office as a community outreach executive. The popular Wynn often was seen around the ballpark interacting with players and fans alike.Two long home runs became particularly famous. In 1967, he knocked one out of Cincinnati's Crosley Field, over the scoreboard in left-center and onto the highway outside the stadium. Three years later, he became the first player to hit a home run into the upper deck of the cavernous Astrodome when he sent a pitch from Phil Niekro more than 500 feet down the left field line. Wynn spent his first 11 seasons in Houston, first with the Colt .45s and then the Astros before playing for the Dodgers, Braves, Brewers, and Yankees over his 15 years. Wynn left the Astros as the franchise leader in hits, home runs, RBI, and walks. Overall, he finished with 291 homers, 964 RBI, and 225 stolen bases in his career. His No. 24 jersey was retired by the Astros in 2005, and he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Astros Hall of Fame last year. In 2011, he was honored by the franchise when a modern baseball facility at the Astros Youth Academy was dubbed the Jimmy Wynn Training Center.(Read more obituary stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/288936/toy-cannon-launched-rockets-for-the-astros.html

"Tomie dePaola, the prolific children's author and illustrator who delighted generations with tales of Strega Nona, the kindly and helpful old witch in Italy, died Monday at age 85 at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, NH, according to his literary agent. He was badly injured in a fall last week and died of complications following surgery, per the AP. The author worked on upward of 270 books over more than a half-century, and nearly 25 million copies have been sold worldwide. His books have been translated into more than 20 languages. Strega Nona, his most endearing character, originated as a doodle at a dull faculty meeting at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, NH, where dePaola was a member of the theater department. The first tale was based on one of his favorite stories as a child, about a pot that keeps producing porridge.Strega Nona: An Original Tale, which came out in 1975, was a Caldecott finalist for best illustrated work. Other books in the series include Strega Nona's Magic Lessons and Strega Nona Meets Her Match. Reflecting on her popularity, dePaola told the AP in 2013, ""I think it's because she's like everybody's grandmother. She's cute, she's not pretty, she's kind of funny looking, but she's sweet, she's understanding. And she's a little saucy—she gets a little irritated every once in a while.""

"Mari Gilbert's four daughters didn't have easy childhoods. Shannan, the oldest, was in foster care when middle sisters Sherre and Sarra were molested by Gilbert's boyfriend. Sarra went on to get an abortion at 14, drop out of school at 16, and have a baby with her drug dealer boyfriend in 2009. Shannan, meanwhile, became an escort, and disappeared on Long Island in 2010 in the middle of an escort call. Mari was consumed with the case, pushing cops to continue investigating her daughter's disappearance—and the search for Shannan ultimately led to the discovery of multiple bodies; the still-unsolved Long Island serial killer case is thought to have claimed as many as 16 victims. Then, in 2016, more than four years after Shannan's remains were found, Mari was killed—by Sarra, who stabbed her mother 227 times, possibly attempting to decapitate her, and beat her with a fire extinguisher before spraying it into her mouth in an attempt to drown her.Sarra's life had continued to be difficult long past childhood, Robert Kolker writes in a long look at Mari Gilbert for the Cut. Sarra and her son's father, who served time on drug charges, would frequently split up and then reunite; Sarra ended up in a shelter for victims of domestic violence at least once. After Shannan's remains were found, Sarra suffered an apparent psychotic break and started suffering delusions; she had attacked her mother once before, claiming Mari was a demon. She was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and lost custody of her son to Mari in February 2016 after drowning her dog in the bathtub while her son was home. With the loss of her son, Sarra also lost her government assistance checks and ended up taking illegal drugs and skipping her antipsychotic drugs. By the end of July, Mari was dead.

"Climate change is imperiling the world's largest animals by increasing the likelihood of fatal collisions between whales and big ships that ply the same waters, the AP reports. Warming ocean temperatures are causing some species of whales in pursuit of food to stray more frequently into shipping lanes, scientists say. The phenomenon already has increased ship strikes involving rare North Atlantic right whales on the East Coast and giant blue whales on the West Coast, researchers say. The number of strikes off California increased threefold in 2018—to at least 10—compared to previous years. When whales are killed in a ship collision, they often sink and don't always wash ashore. So scientists and conservationists say fatal ship strikes are dramatically under-reported.Vessels strikes are among the most frequent causes of accidental death in large whales, along with entanglement in fishing gear. Conservationists, scientists, and animals lovers have pushed for the International Maritime Organization to step up to protect the whales, but it won't happen without cooperation from the worldwide shipping industry. For the right whales, which number only about 400 and have lost more than 10% of their population in just a few years, the death toll is driving them closer to extinction, said Nick Record, senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine. At least three right whales died from ship strikes in 2019—a small number, but still dangerously high for so small a population.(Read more whales stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/288795/whales-face-a-new-threat.html

Neal was the team's slick ballhandler, playing more than 6,000 games for the Globetrotters, TMZ reports. ""His basketball skill was unrivaled by most, and his warm heart and huge smile brought joy to families worldwide,"" said the team's general manager. NBA Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas tweeted a tribute to Neal and another longtime Globetrotter: ""Curly Neal and Marcus Haynes taught me how to dribble."" One writer said, ""If you grew up in the '70s or '80s and you loved this game ... you dreamed of dribbling a basketball like Curly Neal.""Fred Neal led Johnson C. Smith University to the CIAA title, averaging 23 points per game as a senior, before joining the Globetrotters in 1963. When he stopped playing after 22 years in 1985, his jersey was retired by the team, joining only Wilt Chamberlain, Haynes, Meadowlark Lemon, and Goose Tatum, per ESPN. He also appeared in the Globetrotters' TV specials and Scooby-Doo. ""Being a Globetrotter, especially during that time, was as much a responsibility as it was a job,"" Neal wrote in 2016, per USA Today. ""We weren’t just entertainers. I truly believe that we helped ease many of the tensions that pulled at the country. It didn't matter if you were black, white or whatever—laughing and enjoying our games made those barriers disappear.""

"The US government has concluded that retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished more than a decade ago, has died while in the custody of Iran, his family said Wednesday. Shortly after the family's announcement, President Trump told reporters that ""I won't accept that he's dead,"" even though his own acting national intelligence director appeared to confirm the news with a statement conveying sympathies for the Levinsons. The family said in a statement posted on Twitter that it had no information about how or when Levinson had died, but that it occurred before the recent coronavirus outbreak. The family said information that US officials had received led them to conclude that he is dead.US officials communicated the news to Levinson's family in a meeting in Washington in recent weeks, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private encounter. The person said the information about Levinson had come from Iran's foreign minister. ""It is impossible to describe our pain,"" the family's statement said. Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years, US officials would say only that Levinson was working independently on a private investigation. But a 2013 AP investigation revealed that Levinson had been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation.

"The coronavirus has claimed another prominent name. Renowned chef Floyd Cardoz, 59, has died of complications from the virus in a New Jersey hospital, reports People. Two notable claims to fame: Cardoz won Top Chef Masters in 2011, and he opened what Eater NY calls ""one of New York’s greatest restaurants""—Tabla. It was an Indian fine-dining restaurant that earned three stars from the New York Times during its run from 1998 to 2010. Cardoz was born in Bombay, India, and he opened several establishments in both his native country and the US. In addition to Tabla, they include the Bombay Bread Bar and North End Grill in New York City.In an Instagram post earlier this month, Cardoz wrote that he began feeling feverish after flying into New York City on March 8 (he had been in Mumbai), and he admitted himself to the hospital. He also apologized ""for causing undue panic"" with a previous post about his health, but explained that he ""was hugely anxious about my state of health.""

"A sad first for the world, which now has its ""most notable victim of COVID-19,"" per Deadline. Acclaimed playwright Terrence McNally died at a Florida hospital Tuesday of complications due to the coronavirus, his spokesperson confirms. He was 81. McNally, who wrote major works including Master Class, Ragtime, The Ritz, The Full Monty, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, and Love! Valour! Compassion!, had survived lung cancer and had chronic pulmonary disease. Deadline calls McNally ""one of the greatest American playwrights of his generation."" He won four Tony Awards as well as the 2019 lifetime achievement Tony, one Emmy Award, and he had been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. McNally, who is survived by his husband, was hailed as writing landmark works in gay theater; the New York Times says he ""dramatized and domesticated gay life,"" which ""most mainstream theater had previously shunted into comic asides.""Among the topics confronted in his plays were AIDS and homophobia. ""Heartbroken over the loss of Terrence McNally, a giant in our world, who straddled plays and musicals deftly. Grateful for his staggering body of work and his unfailing kindness,"" tweeted Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. Tweeted George Takei, ""Terrence McNally was a legend among legends on Broadway. If you are an actor, there's a good chance you have performed one of his works. If not, you surely will in your career, he was that prolific and gifted. Ah, my heart breaks at the news!"" NPR reports Manu Dibango, a jazz saxophonist who pioneered Afro-funk music, also died in Paris due to the coronavirus. He was 86. As CNN notes, he was sampled by many, most famously Michael Jackson in ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'."" Jackson used a hook from the 1972 song for which Dibango is perhaps best known, ""Soul Makossa,"" singing the line as ""mama-se, mama-sa, ma-makossa.""

"Natasha Ott was planning to watch Netflix with her boyfriend Friday night. Instead, he found her dead on the floor. The 39-year-old was suffering from possible COVID-19 symptoms at the time and still awaiting her coronavirus test results, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. ""For those of you not fortunate enough to have known her, know this: it’s an immeasurable loss,"" her boyfriend, Josh Anderson, writes on Facebook. ""And seeing a woman I knew to be so full of life lying on the floor lifeless was devastating. I was afraid to touch her. I held her anyway."" Ott's harrowing tale began March 10 when she came down with seeming cold symptoms and rejected a coronavirus test at the medical clinic where she worked in New Orleans.""She could have gotten a test last Friday, but they only had five tests, and she didn’t want to use one of them,"" says Anderson. Ott finally took the test Monday when her symptoms (low appetite, fever, respiratory cold) persisted, but she felt strong enough to go for a walk three days later. A relative says she was in overall ""decent health"" excepting a bout of giardia, an intestinal infection, she picked up in Togo while working for the Peace Corps.

"The body of a 13-year-old boy was recovered Saturday in a southeastern Indiana creek, the last of six people presumed to have drowned when two vehicles were swept off a roadway after torrential rainfall deluged the region’s hill country, the AP reports. The boy’s body was found Saturday morning in Sanes Creek, where the bodies of his sisters, ages 7 and 4, and the siblings' mother, Felina Lewis, 35, of Laurel, Indiana, were recovered Friday, said Franklin County Coroner Brian Baxter. The children’s names were not expected to be released. The victims from the other vehicle were identified as Shawn Roberts, 47, and Burton Spurlock, 48. Both men were also Laurel residents. Baxter said autopsies were pending on all six victims, but they are presumed to have drowned.A van and a truck carrying the victims were swept off a roadway into Sanes Creek late Thursday or early Friday after a bridge over the creek was partially washed out when the area received 2-3 inches of rain. Indiana Conservation Officer Josh Thomas said the creek, a tributary of the Whitewater River, quickly surged into a torrent in the region, which has many steep ridges and valleys that are prone to flooding during heavy rainfall. It’s unclear whether the vehicles were washed into the creek at the same time or separately, he said. “It’s terrible. It's hard to fathom,"" Thomas said. “Down here, with all these hills, things flood quickly. A lot of these creeks are very small, but all of a sudden they’re big with a lot of water and a lot of water moving really fast. They go down almost as quickly as they come up.""

CNN reports that a body was found in the Florida Panhandle this week, and it's likely that of 11-year-old Gannon Stauch, who vanished from Colorado Springs in January. Per a release from the El Paso County Sheriff's Office in Colorado, officials there were contacted Wednesday by the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office in Florida with news that a ""deceased juvenile male"" had been found in Pace, about 15 miles northeast of Pensacola. An autopsy tentatively IDed the body as Gannon's, the release says. ""We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the friends and family of Gannon,"" the release notes, adding that, due to a gag order, no further details will be made available.The statement did mention, however, that anyone who'd seen Gannon's stepmother, Letecia Stauch, suspected of murdering Gannon, in either Pace or Pensacola in early February to contact El Paso County authorities. Gannon's mother said earlier this month that Stauch ""will pay 100% for this heinous thing that she did."" CBS Denver says authorities believe Gannon was murdered in the Colorado Springs area. Stauch had previously been charged with first-degree murder of a child under 12 by a person in a position of trust, child abuse resulting in death, tampering with a deceased human body, and tampering with physical evidence.

"Actor-singer Kenny Rogers, the Grammy-winning balladeer who spanned jazz, folk, country, and pop with hits like ""Lucille,"" ""Lady,"" and ""Islands in the Stream"" and embraced his persona as ""The Gambler"" died Friday night. He was 81. He died at home in Sandy Springs, Ga., his representative tells the AP, adding that Rogers was under hospice care and died of natural causes. The Houston-born performer with the husky voice and silver beard sold tens of millions of records, won three Grammys, and was the star of TV movies based on ""The Gambler"" and other songs, making him a superstar in the '70s and '80s. Rogers thrived for some 60 years before he retired from touring in 2017 at age 79. Despite his crossover success, he always preferred to be thought of as a country singer. Rogers was a five-time CMA Award winner and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2013.A true rags-to-riches story, Rogers was raised in public housing in Houston Heights with seven siblings. His breakthrough came when he was asked to join the New Christy Minstrels folk group in 1966, which re-formed as the First Edition. After the group broke up in 1974, Rogers started his solo career and found a big hit with the sad country ballad ""Lucille"" in 1977, which crossed over to the pop charts and earned Rogers his first Grammy. Suddenly a star, Rogers added hit after hit for more than a decade. ""The Gambler,"" the Grammy-winning story song, came out in 1978 and became his signature song, spawning a hit TV movie of the same name and several sequels. Over the years, Rogers worked often with female duet partners, most memorably Dolly Parton, with whom he performed ""Islands in the Stream."" Rogers' family is planning a private service ""out of concern for the national COVID-19 emergency,"" per a statement. A public memorial will be held at a later date.(Read more obituary stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/288466/kenny-rogers-dead-at-81.html

"When a bright white giraffe and her equally colorless calf were first spotted in Kenya in 2017, conservationists worried their lack of camouflage would make them easy targets for predators, if not poachers. Their fears were well-founded. In a devastating blow, it's believed poachers killed the female and a new calf, leaving the 2- to 3-year-old male as the only known white giraffe left in the country, per USA Today. ""This is a very sad day,"" says Mohammed Ahmednoor, manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy, which oversees land on which the giraffe family roamed in Garissa County. The female and her calf born in 2019 hadn't been seen for some time before their bones were discovered by locals some 35 miles northeast of the conservancy. It's believed they were killed four months ago.The giraffes had leucism, a genetic condition resulting in partial loss of pigmentation, which left them with milky white skin but dark eyes. Their killing is ""a blow to the tremendous steps taken by the community to conserve rare and unique species, and a wake-up call for continued support to conservation efforts,"" Ahmednoor says, per the New York Times.

Butler County Sheriff Kelly Herzet tells NBC News that the unidentified woman called her boyfriend—IDed by the sheriff's office as 44-year-old Christopher Johnson, per KWCH—and begged him to bring the little girl home. When Johnson insisted he was fine, Herzet says, the mother contacted the Leon Police Department, and police found him close to 7pm inside his pickup truck near the Walnut River, his daughter on his lap instead of secured in a car seat. Still, Herzet says it initially appeared the incident would end quietly, as officers told Johnson he should hand the toddler over due to his apparent intoxicated state.That's when panic set in, per Herzet, with Johnson putting his foot to the gas and driving straight into the river. ""Alcohol was involved, I think it’s fair to say,"" the sheriff says, per NBC. A 90-minute recovery effort ensued, and around 10pm rescuers found Johnson trapped inside the submerged car, dead.

A coalition spokesman said the recovery of the dead and wounded took some six hours, per Military.com. Officials estimated that some 15 to 19 ISIS fighters had been killed. The Iraqi military said at least 25 ISIS fighters were killed and nine tunnels and a training camp were destroyed, per the Washington Post.These are the first US combat deaths since a Marine Raider, Gunnery Sgt. Scott Koppenhafer, was killed during a mission to track an ISIS suspect in Iraq's Nineveh province in August, though two US personnel were killed in a joint operation between US and Afghan forces last month, per NBC. ""The Makhmur Mountains are historically known to be an ISIS safe haven. However, there is no safe place for ISIS to hide,"" officials said, per Military.com. ""The Coalition, alongside our partner forces, will continue to hunt the remnants of the illegitimate caliphate in order to disrupt any effort to resurge."" There are approximately 5,200 US troops in Iraq to assist in the fight against ISIS. (Read more Marines stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/287974/2-marines-killed-in-raid-on-isis-cave.html

"More than two dozen people, including the trainer of champion Maximum Security, were charged in what authorities described Monday as an international scheme to drug horses to make them race faster. Trainer Jason Servis, whose stable includes the 3-year-old champion, was charged with administering performance-enhancing drugs to that horse and others. Maximum Security crossed the finish line first at the 2019 Kentucky Derby before being disqualified for interference and has since won four of five high-profile races, reports the AP. Charges including drug adulteration and misbranding conspiracy against 27 trainers, vets, and others were detailed in four indictments in Manhattan federal court. ""What actually happened to the horses amounted to nothing less than abuse,” said William Sweeney Jr., assistant director in charge of the FBI New York Office.""They experienced cardiac issues, overexertion leading to leg fractures, increased risk of injury, and, in some cases, death,"" he said. ""Conversely, (humans) involved in the scheme continued to line their purses."" Authorities said participants in the fraud—affecting races in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and the United Arab Emirates—misled federal and state regulators, US Customs and Border Protection agents, various state horse racing regulators, and the betting public. Servis is charged with giving Maximum Security a drug called SGF-1000, recommending it to another trainer, and conspiring with a vet to make it look like a false positive for another substance. Maximum Security on Feb. 29 won the world's richest race, the $10 million Saudi Cup. “A sad day for racing but a long time coming,” trainer Graham Motion tweeted.(Read more horse racing stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/287972/doping-scandal-rocks-horse-racing.html

"He played a chess game against Death in The Seventh Seal, took on the role of an ill-fated priest in The Exorcist, and, most recently, appeared in Game of Thrones as the Three-Eyed Raven. Now, his 65-year career has come to a close: Reps for Max von Sydow confirm the acting legend has died at the age of 90, per Deadline.

Von Sydow became more widely known to American audiences thanks to his role in The Exorcist, followed by starring turns in Flash Gordon, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Minority Report, among many other films and TV series. More recent appearances include his Game of Thrones stint, as well as roles in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and The Simpsons.

"For the Rapa Nui, the iconic moai statues of Easter Island are ""sacred structures,"" Camilo Rapu, the head of the indigenous community there, tells CNN. That's why what went down in the Chilean territory Sunday has the locals distressed and wondering how to better protect the famous basalt structures, a longtime tourist attraction. ""We regret what happened today,"" reads a Facebook post by the Ma'u Henua indigenous group, showing photos of a pickup truck atop what looks like piles of stone. What happened, per People, is that the ""rogue"" truck was parked atop a hill in the Pu a Pau section of the island when there was an apparent brake failure, sending the truck rolling down the hill. It slammed into an ""ahu"" (platform) holding moai, including a 7-foot-tall structure that was destroyed by the truck.""It could not be worse,"" Jo Anne Van Tilburg, head of the Easter Island Statue Project, tells the New York Times. A relative of the driver of the truck says the driver had shoved rocks under the vehicle's tires to keep it from moving while he fished nearby; when he took the rocks out, the truck started sliding down a slope slippery from weeks of downpours. ""He is very stressed and very apologetic,"" the relative says. The driver was reportedly arrested, though it's not clear what charges may be brought against him. ""The damage is incalculable,"" Rapu tells CNN, adding that the damage to the moai ""is an offense to a culture that has lived many years struggling to recover its heritage and archaeology.""

"A judge declared a mistrial Thursday for an Arkansas man convicted of killing his 6-year-old son by sexually assaulting the child with a stick after the man's stepson charged at his stepfather during the sentencing hearing, the AP reports. Circuit Judge Brad Karren granted the request for a mistrial for Mauricio Torres after Torres' stepson testified his stepfather had physically abused him and jumped up from the witness stand after a prosecutor asked about sexual abuse, KHOG-TV reported. The stepson, who is in prison on drug charges, wore shackles on his legs. As he went toward where Torres and his attorneys sat, they flipped the table where they were sitting on its side to stop him. Law enforcement then held the stepson down as he cried and screamed. It was not clear if the stepson had been sexually abused.A Benton County jury on Wednesday found Torres, 50, of Bella Vista, guilty of capital murder and battery during his retrial in the 2015 death of Isaiah Torres. (Mauricio Torres' 2016 conviction and death sentence were overturned by the Arkansas Supreme Court.) He faced death or life in prison without parole. Karren scheduled a hearing for March 19 on whether to grant a new trial only for the sentencing portion. Torres' son died at an Arkansas hospital a day after the assault. Torres' attorneys have said his actions were intended as punishment and the father didn't know they could kill the boy. A medical examiner testified that the boy's death was caused by a bacterial infection resulting from sodomy and chronic child abuse. Torres' wife, Cathy, pleaded guilty in 2017 to capital murder for the child's death and was sentenced to life without parole.(Read more Arkansas stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/287816/mistrial-in-case-of-boy-killed-with-stick-after-courtroom-fracas.html

"A man who survived being shot in the face during a white supremacist's deadly 2012 attack on a Sikh temple near Milwaukee has died of complications stemming from his injuries, the AP reports.

Page killed himself during a firefight with a police officer in the temple parking lot. “I think, collectively as a community, (Singh's death) reopens a lot of wounds that might have scabbed over,” said Pardeep Kaleka, whose father, temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, was killed in the shooting. “But we express condolences to his family and just hope that they over the next couple weeks can have some closure.""Page shot Singh through the cheek, causing a brain injury that left Singh completely paralyzed and struggling with breathing problems, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's office.

His injuries left him susceptible to urinary tract infections and pneumonia, and he was in and out of hospitals dealing with complications, the medical examiner's report said. He was admitted to a hospital in West Allis, another Milwaukee suburb, on Sunday with suspected pneumonia and a urinary tract infection, according to the report. He died Monday afternoon.

"A Florida equestrian competition turned doubly devastating Saturday after a rider and her horse both died in a terrible fall. Katharine Morel of Canada was riding Kerry On on a cross-country course at Altoona's Rocking Horse Winter III Horse Trials, a United States Eventing Association-recognized competition, when the horse fell while jumping a fence. The type of accident is called a rotational fall, and it results in horse and rider somersaulting, with the horse landing on its back. ""Rotational falls are generally the most dangerous falls we see in equestrian sport,"" James Hood, the high performance director for Equestrian Canada, explains to the CBC. The 8-year-old horse died shortly after the fall, and Morel, 33, was brought to a nearby hospital and died there. Equestrian Canada and US Equestrian will investigate the accident and continue to improve safety methods.As Equine Ink explains in an unrelated article, rotational falls typically involve a horse's front legs or chest hitting the fence, which acts as a pivot point for the somersault: ""The rider usually is thrown out of the saddle and goes over the jump before the horse. In a worst-case scenario, the horse can land on the rider."" There are videos of rotational falls here, here, and here; warning, they're difficult to watch, though the riders and horses reportedly survived. Dressage Hub posted a heartbreaking photo of Kerry On's empty stall: ""Canadian Katharine Morel and her horse Kerry On won't be coming home from Florida this year."" ""Today, the equestrian industry lost not just an exceptional athlete, but an exceptional person, as well as the horse she loved,"" Equestrian Canada says in a statement.

But a Chevrolet Malibu belonging to Gerald's mom, 46-year-old Tasha Vandiver, was oddly missing: ""That's what kind of makes this whole thing a little suspicious,"" Monroe County Sheriff Brad Freeman told 13WMAZ at the time.

"Joe Coulombe, the ""Joe"" behind the Trader Joe's name, died Friday at the age of 89 at his home in Pasadena, Calif. His son Joseph confirmed his death after a long illness to the New York Times and Los Angeles Times. Coulombe had been the owner of a chain of convenience stores in the Los Angeles area in the mid-'60s when he became concerned about competition from 7-Eleven. Looking for his own niche, Coulombe stumbled upon some readings that indicated more people than ever were getting a college education, and that a new Boeing plane (the 747) would soon be taking flight and reducing the cost of air travel. That led Coulombe to his target demographic—well-educated, well-traveled consumers with not terribly deep pocketbooks, but who enjoyed diverse food and drink—and he opened his first Trader Joe's in 1967 in Pasadena.What also made the store stand out: its South Seas trading post theme, with friendly employees wearing Hawaiian shirts and using maritime bells to communicate on the job.

"Police on Thursday identified the gunman in the Milwaukee brewery shooting as an electrician whose home was searched earlier in the day. Milwaukee police Chief Alfonso Morales said the shooter was 51-year-old Anthony Ferrill. Morales identified the victims as Molson Coors Brewing employees ranging in age from 33 to 57, the AP reports. Morales said police are still investigating a motive. Police searched Ferrill's home on Milwaukee's north side as they hunted for clues about why the employee killed five co-workers before taking his own life. The house, a one-story home with a large jungle gym in the backyard, was roped off with crime scene tape Thursday morning. A squad car sat in the driveway and a police van was parked at the curb. Investigators could be seen entering the house. Neighbor Erna Roenspies, 82, said Ferrill had worked at the brewery for 15 years as an electrician.The shooting happened Wednesday afternoon at the brewery complex, which employs around 1,000 people.

"David Roback, a driving force in the neo-psychedelic genre and co-founder of California alt-rock band Mazzy Star, has died at age 61, per a representative for the band.

Roback was also a founding member of Opal before teaming up with Hope Sandoval to form Mazzy Star in Santa Monica in 1989. The pair wrote all of the group's songs together, creating a ""gauzy sound [that] became emblematic of the era,"" per the Guardian. Pitchfork notes it was Mazzy Star's second album, 1993's So Tonight That I Might See, that produced their biggest commercial hit, ""Fade Into You.""Per the BBC, Roback and Sanoval were ""reluctant performers,"" though fans flocked to see them. They disappeared from the public eye in 1996, then, after a 17-year break, released Mazzy Star's final full-length album, Seasons of Your Day, in 2013.

"Model, restaurateur and lifestyle guru Barbara ""B."" Smith has died at her Long Island home, her family announced in a statement on social media. She was 70, the AP reports. Smith died Saturday evening after battling early onset Alzheimer's disease, which she was diagnosed with in 2013. She and her husband, Dan Gasby, raised awareness of the disease, and particularly its impacts on the African American community, following her diagnosis. ""Heaven is shining even brighter now that it is graced with B.'s dazzling and unforgettable smile,"" Gasby said in a lengthy Facebook post honoring her life. Smith wrote three cookbooks, founded three successful restaurants and launched a nationally syndicated television show and a magazine.Her successful home products line was the first from a black woman to be sold at a nationwide retailer when it debuted in 2001 at Bed Bath & Beyond. In 1976, she became the second black model to be on the cover of Mademoiselle magazine, after Joli Jones in 1969. Some described Smith as a ""black Martha Stewart,"" a comparison she said she didn't mind though she believed the two lifestyle mavens were quite different. Smith began suffering from memory problems years before her diagnosis. In 2018, Gasby revealed that he was in a relationship with another woman while caring for his ailing wife, leading to harsh criticism from some of her fans.

"The bodies of two longtime friends were found embracing in the back seat of a car that sank Tuesday after plunging off a Miami Beach ferryboat in what's being described as a freak accident. Emma Afra, 63, had driven her Mercedes-Benz to the front of the first of four car lanes on the 113-foot Pelican ferryboat for the 2-mile journey to Miami Beach from Fisher Island, where she lived, reports the Miami Herald. Just as the ferry was departing around 5pm, and for reasons still under investigation, the car drove out of the lane and through a thin barrier marking the spot where cars would exit onto land. A devastating scene was discovered hours later. Afra and her passenger, Viviane Brahms, 75, of Harrison, NY, were found embracing in the back seat of the car, which came to rest upside down some 50 feet below the surface of the channel known as Government Cut.The ferry was reportedly not equipped with a video recording system. But authorities believe Afra, a well-known philanthropist, may have forgotten to put her vehicle in ""park"" and mistakenly hit the gas pedal. She's thought to have driven over chocks used by the crew to keep cars from rolling, according to investigators. Footage of the scene showed a vacant parking spot at the front of the boat behind what the Washington Post describes as a ""blue tarp"" barrier that had been torn down.

Police found their burned bodies in a Milwaukee garage on Sunday afternoon, about a week after Banks was reported missing. Ivery told investigators that he killed his girlfriend and her daughters on Feb. 8 after a fight with Banks. He said she was upset over his decision to go to work as a security guard so soon after the Feb. 7 funeral of their 1-year-old son, Arzel Ivery Jr. Arzel had a history of asthma and died Jan. 24 from respiratory problems, according to autopsy reports.Ivery said Banks yelled at him that he did not care about their son's death, then she picked up a knife and said she did not want to live, according to the complaint.

"A 6-year-old girl who disappeared from her front yard after school was strangled by a neighbor who then killed himself, authorities said Tuesday. Faye Marie Swetlik died just hours after she was abducted, Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher told reporters, per the AP. Her body was found nearly three days later in woods near her home and had been put there just hours earlier, Fisher said. Between that time, investigators had spoken with the suspect. Coty Scott Taylor let them search his home a few doors down from the girl. They saw nothing to suggest the girl was ever there, Cayce Public Safety Director Byron Snellgrove said. Shortly after the girl's body was found, authorities said, they were called to Taylor's home where he was found dead on his back porch, covered in blood.Taylor, 30, slit his own throat, Fisher said in a statement released after Tuesday's news conference, in which the coroner only wanted to talk in front of cameras about the girl. Fisher also refused to release any details about the condition of the girl's body or disclose any other way she might have been injured out of respect for her family. Snellgrove also didn't talk about why Taylor, with no criminal record, would have kidnapped the girl. He said last week that Taylor did not know the girl or her family. The girl was last seen alive playing in her Cayce front yard after getting off the school bus on Feb. 10. The clue that cracked the case came from a trash can. Investigators followed a trash truck going around the neighborhood Thursday and sifted through every can as it was emptied.

"The Price Is Right has halted production while host Drew Carey grieves for murdered ex-fiancee Amie Harwick. Production company execs confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that tapings of the CBS show scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday this week have been called off and will be rescheduled for the week of Feb. 24 or March 2. Harwick, a well-known family and sex therapist, was found gravely injured outside her Hollywood Hills home early Saturday and died in a nearby hospital. She started dating Carey in 2017 and they were engaged the following year, but broke up a few months later. Gareth Pursehouse, a more recent ex, was arrested Saturday and is being held on $2 million bond.The suspension of production will not affect airings of The Price Is Right this week because episodes are recorded months in advance, Variety reports. ""Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime,"" the 61-year-old Carey said Monday, per Deadline. ""She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women, and passionate about her work as a therapist. I am overcome with grief."" Harwick, 38, is also being mourned by her clients, CNN reports. ""Her work changed my life,"" model Emily Sears tweeted.

"Dr. Amie Harwick, who was engaged to Drew Carey for about a year before splitting in 2018, was murdered in the wee hours of Saturday, and another ex of hers has been arrested. LAPD officers responded to her home in the Hollywood Hills after reports of a woman screaming; her roommate, who'd fled over a wall and to a neighbor's house to call police, met them and told them Harwick was being assaulted inside her home. Officers found the 38-year-old unresponsive on the ground underneath a third-floor balcony, with grave injuries consistent with a fall. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she died, Deadline reports. Police say there were signs of forced entry and a struggle inside the home of Harwick, a well-known family and sex therapist who appeared in the 2015 documentary Addicted to Sexting, and detectives learned she'd been concerned about an ex-boyfriend hurting her, TMZ reports.Indeed, she'd had a restraining order against Gareth Pursehouse, 41, but it had expired, and police say the two, who'd only recently broken up, had seen each other during the past couple of weeks. Pursehouse was arrested outside his Playa del Rey residence Saturday afternoon on suspicion of murder. Carey broke his silence after news of the murder broke Monday, telling Fox News in a statement, ""Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime. She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women, and passionate about her work as a therapist. I am overcome with grief. I would like to thank you in advance for giving myself and everyone who loved Amie privacy while we try to work through this tragic situation.""

"Vandals hit Plymouth Rock and nearby memorials with red paint overnight, but if they had a message to impart, authorities haven't figured it out yet. Most of the vandalism at the Massachusetts landmarks was indecipherable, but the vandals did paint ""508"" and ""MOF"" legibly, reports USA Today. The area code of Plymouth is 508, though it's not clear whether that's the connection. The vandals also hit a statue, a monument, and other historical markers, and maintenance crews were busy power-washing them all. CBS Boston reports that the famous rock, symbolizing where Pilgrims stepped onto the shores of America, was pretty much cleaned by Monday afternoon.""We are saddened and sickened by the recent vandalism in our historic town,"" tweeted town manager Melissa Arrighi, along with a photo of a vandalized statue.

"British TV presenter Caroline Flack was found dead of an apparent suicide Saturday afternoon. Hours prior, around 10:30pm on Valentine's Day, someone called emergency services from Flack's home and an ambulance responded, the Sun reports. Paramedics assessed Flack, but did not take her to the hospital, a London Ambulance spokesperson tells Sky News. No further details were given, citing confidentiality, but a source tells the Sun, ""Caroline had been unwell on Friday but by the time crews got there she was feeling much better and was coherent and responsive to them. She refused to go to hospital."" Sources say Flack, who had just learned the case against her for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend would not be dropped, was so upset that her best friend came to stay with her that night; she and other friends were there when the ambulance arrived.But it is believed that shortly after she told her best friend it was fine for her to leave the following morning, Flack took her own life. Flack's team has lambasted Crown Prosecution Service for proceeding with the ""show trial"" despite Flack's boyfriend Lewis Burton withdrawing his complaint, and critics are also denouncing the British tabloid media's unsavory coverage of Flack, which started long before the December incident. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is even calling on social media companies to do more to remove unacceptable content following Flack's death, the Guardian reports. Page Six, citing the Times of London, reports Flack warned police she would kill herself if charged in the alleged attack, and the Sun's sources say Flack, who had struggled with mental health issues, self-harmed during the incident. Critics are saying she should have received psychiatric care rather than criminal charges. Also making headlines Monday was Flack's brief 2009 romance with Prince Harry.

"""As a parent, as any other human being, it was horrific."" That's how a woman who ran to help victims of a car accident in Missouri described the scene she encountered Friday to CBS 17—one that took the lives of two former volleyball stars and their respective 12-year-old daughters, all Louisville residents on their way to a club volleyball tourney. CNN reports that 40-year-old Lesley Prather, who once played for the University of Louisville, and her daughter Rhyan, as well as Syracuse University alum Carrie McCaw, 44, and her daughter Kacey, all died in the crash on Interstate 64 in St. Charles County. Per WLKY, the group's minivan and another vehicle were hit by a pickup truck that veered out of its lane and across the median. Prather and one of the 12-year-olds were pronounced dead at the scene, while McCaw and the second girl died at local hospitals, according to a crash report.The Courier Journal notes the ""void in Louisville's vibrant volleyball community that crosses generations,"" adding that both Prather and McCaw had been coaches with the Kentucky Indiana Volleyball Academy. Prather, a two-time All-Conference USA player, graduated from the University of Louisville in 2002 and was the head volleyball coach from 2009 to 2012 at Indiana University Southeast, where she never had a losing record, the school says in a statement, per CNN. McCaw was a record-breaking player for Syracuse from 1994 to 1997 and coached at Rutgers for a year before going on to a 20-year career with a law firm. Both women had four children each with their husbands. An investigation into the crash continues; no charges have been issued or arrests made, though a final crash report will be sent to the county's prosecuting attorney's office to see if charges are warranted.

"A popular reality TV host in the UK has been found dead ahead of her trial on charges of assaulting her boyfriend, reports People. Caroline Flack, 40, best known for her stint hosting Love Island, was found in her London apartment. No cause of death has been released, but a family lawyer said Flack committed suicide, reports the AP. In December, police charged Flack with assaulting boyfriend Lewis Burton, described as a model and former professional tennis player. Flack denied the charges, but she stepped down from her role with Love Island, which she had hosted since it began in 2015. It wasn't clear whether the couple was still together—the Guardian notes that Burton posted a Valentine's photo of the couple last week, while Flack posted photos of herself and her dog.""We can confirm that our Caroline passed away today on the 15th February,"" says a family statement. ""We would ask that the press both respect the privacy of the family at this difficult time."" Details about the alleged assault on Burton were scant, but they came after police went to Flack's home on a domestic violence call. Prosecutors alleged Burton sustained a head injury in an altercation, and Flack's trial was due to begin in March. As for the show that made Flack famous: ITV's Love Island deposits young people on a tropical island, but the AP notes that the program has courted controversy in part because two former contestants committed suicide.

"A blaze that tore through a Haitian children's home on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince killed 15 children, putting the Pennsylvania-based Christian nonprofit that runs it once more under the microscope. Rose-Marie Louis, a worker at the Orphanage of the Church of Bible Understanding, tells the AP the fire started around 9pm Thursday, and that it took firefighters about an hour and a half to get there. The home—which a UNICEF rep tells CNN isn't technically an orphanage, but a children's center, as about 80% of the children who live in such centers in Haiti have at least one living parent who just can't afford to raise them— had been using candles due to a faulty generator, Louis says.She adds that about half of the dead were babies or toddlers, while the other half were around 10 or 11 years old. Reuters reports two children burned to death, while the other 13 died from smoke inhalation.Jovenel Moise, Haiti's president, said in a tweet he was ""deeply moved"" by the children's deaths and urged ""urgent measures"" to find out what happened. The AP notes the two children's homes in Haiti run by the Church of Bible Understanding have long been plagued with issues. After inspections that began in 2012 found overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and poorly trained staff, the group lost accreditation for the homes. A local judge who surveyed the charred center Friday tells AFP there were no fire extinguishers to be seen and that living conditions were ""truly, truly neglected,"" leaving the children ""living like animals."" As for the kids displaced by the fire, the head of Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare and Research tells Reuters the children will be placed in a ""transit center"" while arrangements are made to reunite them with their families.

"A Michigan woman who broke the hearts and emptied the wallets of couples eager to adopt babies was sentenced to 21 months in prison Wednesday after acknowledging that she faked her own pregnancy and committed other acts of deception. There were no children to adopt, the AP reports. In one case, Enhelica Wiggins told a couple to meet her at a hospital in Alma, Michigan, where she would give birth by cesarean section. She saw them in the parking lot but drove off. ""This one screams for punishment,"" US District Judge Bernard Friedman told Wiggins. The judge called it an ""egregious"" case—the ""bottom, bottom, bottom lowest thing."" Wiggins, 29, of Saginaw County pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced at the top of the guidelines. The leader of the scam, Tara Lee, faces a longer sentence March 26. Wiggins and Lee tricked couples into believing they could arrange adoptions by connecting them to pregnant women. Wiggins sometimes posed as a birth mother on three-way calls.Wiggins' conduct was fueled by a drug addiction, her attorney said. ""I'm so sorry. I feel horrible,"" Wiggins said, turning to John Crouch, a victim. Crouch, 42, told the judge that he and his wife longed to become parents but ""were being led around like stray puppies"" by Wiggins. Outside court, Crouch said the tipping point came in the parking lot of the Alma hospital last year. He said Wiggins, who will have to pay restitution to victims, promised to return to give birth after taking her kids to a relative's house. She didn't return. Crouch and his wife paid $63,000, according to court documents. ""They always thought they were on the brink of becoming parents,"" a prosecutor said said of the victims.

"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is offering $20,000 for information on a dolphin killer or killers after two animals were found dead within a week. Biologists with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission found a dolphin that appeared to have been shot in the face off Naples late last week, shortly before experts with the Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge found a dolphin on the Pensacola shoreline with a bullet hole in its left side, reports the Miami Herald. This follows the discovery last summer of a dolphin impaled near its right eye along Upper Captiva Island, west of Fort Myers. It was in a begging posture, as was the dolphin found off Naples, per the Fort Myers News-Press.It's for that reason that authorities believe the animals were looking for a meal when killed. NOAA expert Stacey Horstman notes dolphins who learn to associate humans with food may follow boats, irritating human occupants. ""If the dolphin is begging, do not try to engage with that animal in any way,"" she tells the News-Press, though she adds ""it's really hard for a lot of people to see how a simple thing like feeding a dolphin can lead to shocking and egregious behavior like this."" It's a federal offense to feed, harass, hunt, or kill wild dolphins, punishable by up to a year in jail and fines up to $100,000, though an NOAA rep notes cases are rarely solved without help from the public.

"More than 2,400 fetal remains found in the possession of a late abortion doctor now have a final resting place. All remains will be buried Wednesday in a single grave at Southlawn Cemetery in South Bend, Ind., in compliance with a state law requiring fetal remains be buried or cremated after an abortion, per Fox News. Dr. Ulrich Klopfer was based in South Bend, though most remains were found at his home in Crete, Ill., a mile from the Indiana state line, following his death in September at age 79. It's unclear if he was a hoarder or simply sought to avoid disposal costs. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill will preside over the burial before providing an update on the probe into Klopfer. Often the only abortion doctor serving South Bend, Gary, and Fort Wayne, he performed tens of thousands of abortions over four decades before his license was suspended in 2016.Among other issues, Klopfer was accused of performing an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim without notifying law enforcement. He claimed conservative state officials collaborated to shutter his business with anti-abortion groups. Upon his death, relatives found 2,246 sets of remains piled in his garage. Remains from another 165 fetuses were found in the trunk of a car at a business where Klopfer stored vehicles. All came from abortions performed from 2000 to 2003, per WXIN. ""I'm so grateful that, finally, the bodies of these little boys and girls will be treated with the dignity they deserved,"" says Right to Life's Cathie Humbarger. Hill's defense of state laws restricting abortion is at the center of a reelection campaign at risk over allegations that he groped four women at a bar in 2018, though ""being in the spotlight during the burial could help shore up support among social conservatives,"" per ABC News.

"This has got to be up there on the list of a moving company's worst nightmares: Movers dropped and destroyed a grand piano worth an estimated $194,000. The piano, a handmade Fazioli, belonged to Canadian virtuoso Angela Hewitt, whom CNN calls ""one of the world's leading classical pianists."" A heartbroken Hewitt announced the loss Sunday on Facebook, saying she'd been too shocked in the immediate aftermath of the incident 10 days prior to reveal what had happened. ""At the end of my most recent CD recording sessions (Beethoven Variations in Berlin), when I was so happy with the results and feeling elated, the piano movers came into the control room (where I was finishing up with my producer) to say they had dropped my precious Fazioli concert grand piano. My very own that I have used for all of my CD recordings done in Europe since 2003 (and of course for many concerts),"" she wrote.Paolo Fazioli, the owner of Fazioli Pianos, declared the F278—the only one of that model in the world with four pedals—unsalvageable. ""The iron frame is broken, as well as much else in the structure and action (not to mention the lid and other parts of the case),"" Hewitt wrote. ""It's kaputt. The movers of course were mortified. In 35 years of doing their job, this had never happened before. At least nobody was hurt."" The Guardian notes the piano weighed 1,300 pounds. Hewitt says that after the ""insurance saga,"" she will ultimately choose a new Fazioli, but will still mourn the loss of her old one. ""I adored this piano. It was my best friend, best companion.

"Family members of a 17-year-old boy killed with a BB gun are demanding answers of the man whose 8-year-old son fired the fatal shot. Ivan Johnson, 17, died Feb. 4, three days after he was accidentally shot in the left eye, according to police in Tampa, Florida. Johnson was riding in the front passenger seat of a car driven by an unidentified man, while the man's 8-year-old son and 10-year-old stepson rode in the backseat, report CNN and Bay News 9. As the man got out of the car to visit an ATM, police say his younger son grabbed a loaded Daisy 800 BB/pellet rifle, which went off. ""I wasn't expecting it to be as detrimental as it was when I got to the hospital,"" Johnson's mother, Camisha Denny, tells WFLA.Johnson was ultimately taken off life support. ""We hope that he definitely is responsible for what he's done,"" Johnson's father, Solomon Johnson, says of the driver. ""Even though it was an 8-year-old child that pulled the trigger, I think a responsible parent would have put the gun somewhere else and not in the backseat."" No charges have been filed, though the incident remains under investigation. The driver has since reportedly left the area for Ft. Lauderdale. Meanwhile, some $5,000 has been raised for Johnson's family on GoFundMe. He was ""the big brother, the best friend, the inspiration and the SMILE to all,"" the page reads, noting Johnson ""was able to change the lives of 9 children and their families"" as an organ donor.

"Robert Conrad, the rugged, contentious actor who starred in the hugely popular 1960s television series Hawaiian Eye and The Wild Wild West, died Saturday, the AP reports. He was 84. The actor died of heart failure in Malibu, Calif., family spokesperson Jeff Ballard said. A small private service is planned for March 1, which would have been his 85th birthday. ""He lived a wonderfully long life and while the family is saddened by his passing, he will live forever in their hearts,"" Ballard said. With his good looks and strong physique, Conrad was a rising young actor when he was chosen for the lead in Hawaiian Eye. He became an overnight star after the show debuted in 1959. Conrad played Tom Lopaka, a daring private investigator whose partner was Tracy Steele, played by Anthony Eisley.After five seasons with the show, Conrad went on to embrace the television craze of the time, period Westerns, but with a decidedly different twist. In The Wild, Wild West, which debuted in 1965, he was James T. West, a James Bond-like agent who used innovative tactics and futuristic gadgets to battle bizarre villains. Conrad also starred in Baa Baa Black Sheep and numerous films including Young Dillinger, Murph the Surf, The Bandits, The Lady in Red, and Wrong Is Right. Throughout Hollywood, Conrad had a reputation as a tough customer and was sued more than a half-dozen times as a result of fist fights. ""If you treat me nicely, I'll treat you nicer,"" he once said.

Preliminary results showed, per the BBC, that there were 123 HIV infections among volunteers who received a placebo and 129 among those who received the vaccine.

"Orson Bean, the witty actor and comedian, was hit and killed by a car in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was 91, the AP reports. The Los Angeles County coroner's office confirmed Bean's Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a ""traffic-related"" fatality. The coroner's office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from local news outlets. A man was walking in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Brian Wendling initially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene. Police were investigating and didn't identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.Bean enlivened such TV game shows as To Tell the Truth and played a crotchety merchant on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. He appeared in a number of films—notably, Anatomy of a Murder and Being John Malkovich—and starred in several top Broadway productions. His career also took unexpected turns: He was blacklisted during the Cold War ""because I had a cute communist girlfriend,"" he once said, took time off in the 1970s to live a hippie lifestyle in Australia, and later became a conservative commentator on Breitbart. Born in Burlington, Vermont, in 1928 as Dallas Frederick Burrows, he never lost the Yankee accent that proved a perfect complement to the dry, laconic storytelling that established him as popular humorist.

"Jamie Maynard has been clean for three years, a feat she credits in part to having gone to prison, where she got off heroin. But in a lengthy piece for the New Yorker, Paige Williams makes the case that she should have never been behind bars. The Ohio woman was charged in August 2015 with involuntary manslaughter, trafficking, and ""corrupting another with drugs""—over some heroin she gave a friend named Courtney Penix. Facing as much as 20 years, Maynard pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 4 years, 11 months. Her case is at the center of Williams' look at the surge in overdose-homicide prosecutions, which are ostensibly meant to scoop up big traffickers and repeat offenders but much more often target people like Maynard: friends, family, or partners who aren't profiting from their role but are simply fellow users.Maynard herself got hooked on drugs while working as a licensed blackjack dealer at the Hollywood Casino. The pay and benefits were good, but the repetitive nature of the work caused an old rotator-cuff injury to flare up. She started taking black-market opioids for the pain but transitioned to the much-cheaper heroin when her habit hit $600 a week. ""A dabbler uses to get high; a person with an addiction uses to stay well,"" writes Williams, and the bulk of the texts Penix sent the then-26-year-old Maynard were along those lines: The 24-year-old Penix generally needed Xanax, Suboxone, or heroin, stat, to avoid an unbearable withdrawal. On April 27, 2015, Maynard grabbed the heroin Penix had requested when she was at her dealer's and met her in the Walmart parking lot. Hours later Maynard got this text from Penix's number: ""Courtney has passed away from an overdose.""

""It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103,"" his son Michael Douglas wrote on Instagram, per the Hollywood Reporter. The actor known for his dimples and fierce gaze acted in a wide range of films, from The Bad and the Beautiful to Champion to Lust for Life and Paths of Glory. The three-time Oscar nominee (and recipient of an honorary Oscar in 1996) is also cherished in Hollywood for breaking the 1950s blacklist by crediting Dalton Trumbo for his screenplay on Spartacus, in which Douglas starred. He was also a political activist, family man, and charity benefactor, notes Variety.His intense ambition was rooted in family. Born to Russian Jewish immigrants in Amsterdam, NY, Douglas was the poor son of a ragman. He rose up by putting himself through university, served in the Navy, and returned to civilian life to act on Broadway and, soon after, in Hollywood. A rebel with strong opinions—and a reputation for being difficult—he started his own film company and made his own films. He was married twice and had four sons, who all went into the movie business. A 1996 stroke nearly led him to suicide, but he fought on.

"Macy's says it is closing 125 of its least productive stores and cutting 2,000 corporate jobs as the struggling department store tries to reinvent itself in the age of online shopping, the AP reports. The store closures represent about one fifth of Macy's current total. The stores, which include about 30 that are in the process of closing, account for $1.4 billion in annual sales. Macy's didn't specify how many jobs would be lost at the shuttered stores. The corporate jobs will be shed as Macy's closes its offices in Cincinnati and San Francisco, leaving New York as its sole corporate headquarters. Macy's is also testing a new store format that's located at a strip center, instead of a mall. The moves announced Tuesday come ahead of Macy's annual investor meeting where CEO Jeff Gennette is expected to unveil a three-year reinvention plan.

"There’s a ""quiet apocalypse"" happening among insect populations around the world, and fireflies may soon be the next to see their lights dimmed for good. New research out of Tufts University published in the journal BioScience warns that the world’s 2,000 or so species of the bioluminescent beetles—also called lightning bugs in some parts—are in danger of extinction. To figure out what’s putting fireflies at risk, researchers distributed a survey to entomology experts well versed in firefly behavior, ecology, and conservation, asking for their opinions on what firefly populations should be worried about. The top three threats that emerged: pesticides, habitat loss, and pollution from artificial lights such as street lights, commercial signs, and sky glow.Habitat loss was deemed the biggest threat by the 50 or so respondents. ""Some species get hit especially hard by habitat loss because they need specific conditions to complete their life cycle,"" study lead author Sara Lewis says in a release. Artificial light, meanwhile, which CNN notes has grown exponentially over the past century, is considered to be the biggest buzzkill when it comes to courtship. ""In addition to disrupting natural biorhythms—including our own—light pollution really messes up firefly mating rituals,"" study co-author Avalon Owens adds in the release. What's known as ""firefly tourism"" (where people converge to admire the fireflies) is also hastening their demise, as habitats and the bugs themselves get literally squashed. The researchers hope their work will raise awareness of the issue. ""We want to keep fireflies lighting up our nights for a long, long time,"" co-author Sonny Wong tells CNN.

"Annie Sandifer was 26 weeks pregnant with her sixth child when a bullet from a drive-by shooting struck her early Saturday.

She had a whole family,"" Sandifer's aunt and best friend tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Sandifer was on a party bus parked outside Gene's Supper Club, a popular nightspot, when five to six rounds were fired from the sunroof of a car driving by. The bus drove Sandifer to a nearby hospital, where her baby is currently in stable condition. Relatives tell WISN he weighed 3 pounds and is named Tyrese.""I'm trying to get all my kids to move out of here because it's just not safe,"" Sandifer's father tells CBS 58.

"A 12-year-old girl died this week in southern Egypt after her parents brought her to a doctor who performed female genital mutilation, a criminal practice that remains widespread in the region, according to a judicial statement. The girl's death in the province of Assiut prompted Egypt's public prosecutor to order the arrests of her parents and the physician who preformed the procedure, the AP reports. Since the mid-1990s, Egypt has been battling the centuries-old practice, which is misguidedly believed to control women's sexuality. In 2008, a law banning the cutting of female genitalia was passed despite strong opposition from conservative voices. But a 2015 government survey found that 87% percent of all Egyptian women between 15 and 49 years old have been circumcised.""Many more Egyptian girls will be forced to undergo the procedure, and many of them will die—as long as there is no clear strategy from the state and a true criminalization of the practice,"" Amel Fahmy, managing director of Tadwein Gender Research Center, said Friday. In 2016, the Egyptian law was changed to redefine FGM from a misdemeanor to a felony, which draws tougher sentences and punishments. But women's rights advocates argue the law still contains loopholes. In 2016, a criminal court sentenced two doctors and the mother of a 17-year-old who died after FGM to only a one-year suspended sentence each, a verdict that drew sharp criticism from activists. ""Judges themselves are not convinced that female circumcision is a crime that should be punished,"" said a human rights lawyer.(Read more female genital mutilation stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/286346/parents-doctor-arrested-in-genital-mutilation-death.html

He was reported missing on Jan. 14 and relatives say he had been receiving death threats from a gang, reports the BBC. His body was found in the town of Ocampo not far from where he was last seen. Prosecutors said last week that 53 police officers—the entire police forces of Ocampo and the nearby town of Angangueo—had been detained for questioning regarding the disappearance.The mountain forests of Michoacan are a key overwintering site for monarch butterflies, which travel to Mexico from the US and Canada every year in a round-trip that can involve several generations of butterflies traveling up to 6,000 miles. Gomez was a devoted campaigner for the protection of monarch butterflies and their habitat, which is threatened by illegal logging. The El Rosario sanctuary he managed opened in November.

"The pilot of Kobe Bryant's helicopter told air traffic control he was climbing higher to avoid a layer of clouds. It was the last communication from Ara Zobayan before the chopper crashed into a hillside in Calabasas, Calif., says Jennifer Homendy of the National Transportation Safety Board, per CNN. When air traffic controllers asked the pilot for more details, Zobayan did not respond. The ensuing crash killed all nine aboard. Earlier, the pilot had asked controllers to keep track of the helicopter in heavy fog, but as he neared the hills of Calabasas, they told him he was now too low too show up on radar, reports the Los Angeles Times. Zobayan began a rapid ascent, enough to clear the hills. ""What happened next was mysterious,"" per the Times. The chopper went off course, then entered into a rapid descent and never recovered.An aviation consultant tells the newspaper that the rapid ascent, followed by a rapid descent, suggests the pilot realized he was too close to the ground and was trying to correct. In addition to the warning about not showing up on radar, it's likely a warning device in the chopper would have been saying, ""Terrain!"" ""Terrain"" over and over. A pilot can easily become ""spatially disoriented"" while climbing rapidly after such a warning, the consultant says. Earlier in the flight, Zobayan had received permission to fly by Special Visual Flight Rules, meaning visibility was so bad he had to rely on instruments and air traffic control guidance.

"""After we tried that case, I think they'd have given her a death penalty in a heartbeat. That’s the effect she had on the jury."" So say the Muskingum County prosecutors involved in the case of Emile Weaver, a Delta Gamma Theta sorority sister at Muskingum University's New Concord, Ohio, campus who on April 22, 2015, gave birth in a half bathroom at her sorority house. Two of her sorority sisters later found the infant's lifeless body in a tightly knotted black trash bag in a garbage bin outside. Weaver ended up being convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to life without parole. In a wide-ranging piece for Elle, Alex Ronan delves into the topic of neonaticides, Weaver's difficult upbringing, and her awareness of—and fierce denial of—her pregnancy.Ronan recounts how she attempted to visit an abortion clinic in November 2014 but was forced to turn around after an ice storm closed the roads, for instance. But Weaver also testified that ""I said no so many times that in my mind none of this was happening."" She maintains that while her daughter, subsequently named Addison Grace, was born alive, she did not kill her. Ronan also follows the journey of Weaver's sorority sisters—at first her fiercest defenders, they ultimately supported the prosecution. It's a big arc: The sister who confirmed ""it's a whole f---ing baby"" in the bag went online after Weaver's arrest to slap back at critics, writing in one case, ""That's my sister and you do not know the half of it."" After hearing the evidence at the trial, she changed her mind; she told Ronan she was relieved when Weaver's sentence was upheld.

"A New York Police Department officer and his fiancee were charged with second-degree murder Friday after the transit officer's 8-year-old son was allegedly left in an unheated, unfinished garage overnight and froze to death. Michael Valva, 40, and Angela Pollina, 42, have both pleaded not guilty. As NBC News and CNN report, Valva called 911 the morning of Jan. 17 to report his son Thomas had fallen in the driveway and lost consciousness while waiting for the school bus, and Suffolk County officers responded to the Long Island home to find Valva performing CPR on the boy in the basement of the home. His body temperature was 76 degrees, and upon investigating, a police rep says, ""We ... determined that Thomas was never in the driveway that morning, and he suffered head and facial injuries that were not consistent with his father's account.""The boy was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, and the medical examiner ruled the cause of death homicide with a major contributing factor of hypothermia. A county source tells the New York Post Valva allegedly got angry with Thomas the night before his death, beat him, and left him in the garage as punishment. The temperature overnight was 19 degrees. Valva and Pollina even allegedly mocked the boy for how cold he was before he died, the Post reports. The couple also had custody of Valva's two other sons and Pollina's three daughters, and police say they've found evidence all the children were closely monitored and some of them were deprived of food and punished severely. Valva's ex-wife, who lost custody of her three boys in 2017, tells the Post and NBC New York that she knew the couple was abusive and had been trying for years to get help.

"Jim Lehrer, who co-founded PBS' NewsHour and anchored the show for decades until his retirement in 2011, died Thursday at age 85, the public broadcasting station announced. Lehrer, who started his journalism career in Dallas in the 1960s, was the founding co-anchor, along with Robert MacNeil, of a single-topic PBS news program starting in 1975. In 1983, it expanded to the multi-topic MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour; after MacNeil retired in 1995, it became NewsHour With Jim Lehrer. But while Lehrer was for years a familiar face for public television viewers, the New York Times says he became a household name in part thanks to the dozen presidential debates he moderated. He started in 1988 (Bush vs. Dukakis) and then continued in every presidential campaign through 2012, sometimes moderating multiple debates in one year.Lehrer, who ""died peacefully in his sleep"" at his Washington home, per PBS, also wrote multiple novels, four plays, and three memoirs; hosted a 12-part series on modern China; hosted an Emmy-winning documentary based on his experience with heart surgery; and himself won multiple Emmys and numerous other awards and honors. He and MacNeil were known for their civil, unbiased, and in-depth reporting, and during his career, Lehrer interviewed presidents, prime ministers, lawmakers, titans of business, and other well-known people. PBS says one of his ""most notable"" sit-downs was with Bill Clinton as Kenneth Starr was investigating allegations of the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky; he also, the station notes, was ""calm and careful"" in his coverage of the September 11 terrorist attacks. He is survived by his wife, three daughters, and six grandchildren. (Read more Jim Lehrer stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/286007/an-iconic-news-anchor-is-dead-at-85.html

"The photos are jarring and have been seen around the world: malnourished lions kept in rusted cages at a Sudanese zoo that can no longer afford to care for them. Osman Salih, the activist who first posted the photos to Facebook, wrote that ""their bones are protruding from the skin."" Some of the animals were said to weigh just one-third of what they once did. ""Food is not always available, so often we buy it from our own money to feed them,"" said a park manager, per AFP. Original reports put the number of skeletal lions left at the zoo in Khartoum at five, but the flurry of recent attention they received apparently wasn't enough: Another activist says two of them have since died, leaving two lions and a lioness, reports the AP.""Today was a positive day"" at the park, however, Salih had posted Sunday. Donors brought meat, as well as antibiotics and IV drips, per India Today, and volunteers cleaned up the zoo and did maintenance work. Sudan's skyrocketing food prices sparked a 2019 protest movement that led to the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir.

Bartlett says that the shooter confessed to other students but has not admitted guilt to the police nor helped in their investigation.District Attorney Kim Ogg said that based on evidence gathered so far, the shooting does not appear to have been intentional, the AP reports. She said the students were part of the school's ROTC program and there is no indication that they'd been fighting before the shooting. ""They were friends,"" Ogg said. ""Pulling a trigger on a gun, whether you know if it’s loaded or not, is an intentional act. But he did not, based on the evidence we have right now, intend to kill his friend."" Authorities are still looking for the gun, which Bartlett says the student brought from home. It was not school property nor issued by the ROTC, he says. ""This is a regular kid, evidently, who is now a violent offender,” Ogg said of the shooter. ""Whether he meant to be violent or not, he killed somebody. And that somebody was a son, and a student, and a friend, and it’s our community's collective loss.""(Read more Texas stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/285696/da-texas-teen-mistakenly-killed-friend-in-school.html

"A 14-year-old lion at the Brookfield Zoo near Chicago mysteriously fell into her enclosure's dry moat and died less than two weeks after her mate was put down for age-related issues, officials said. After the female African lion named Isis didn't show any signs of recovery from the 15-foot fall, the zoo's veterinary staff decided to euthanize her, the Chicago Tribune reported. Zoo staff said her death was unexpected, mysterious and especially difficult, the AP reports. The lion was fine when staff checked on her at 9am Monday, an hour before the zoo opened, but she was found unresponsive at the bottom of the moat a half-hour later, said William Zeigler, senior vice president of animal programs. Her fall wasn't seen by anyone or caught on camera.The design of the moat allows a lion to climb back out on the habitat side, but Isis essentially didn't move during roughly 24 hours of treatment and observation before her death. “Right now, it's just a tragic accident and we're trying to make heads or tails of it,” Zeigler said. “We don't really know what happened.” Staffers who cared for the big cats watched Isis closely after the death of her longtime mate, Zenda, and although she did call out more frequently, Zeigler said she seemed to get over the death within a few days. “At a tabloid (newspaper), it would be an anthropomorphic question"" about whether Isis had somehow given up the will to live, Zeigler said. However, nothing in her behavior indicated that was the case. A CT scan showed that Isis had no broken bones but that she did have seizures indicating possible swelling of the brain. An autopsy will be conducted to determine what killed her.(Read more zoo stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/285679/2-weeks-after-death-of-mate-lion-falls-into-zoo-moat-dies.html

"The search for the Ohio boy who went missing on Dec. 20 after heading off to school that morning has come to a tragic end: The body of Harley Dilly, 14, was found Monday night in the chimney of an unoccupied summer home that was in the process of being renovated, People reports. ""It appears that Harley climbed an antenna tower to the roof and entered the chimney,"" Port Clinton Police Department Chief Robert Hickman said at a press conference Tuesday. ""Once in the chimney, Harley’s jacket and glasses were pushed from the chimney through a flue and into the second floor of the house,"" but the teen himself got stuck in the 9-inch-by-13-inch space.Foul play is not suspected, and the Ottawa County Coroner says the boy's death appears to have been accidental. Final autopsy results are still pending, but the coroner says the cause of death was compressive asphyxia, which happens when weight or pressure on the body keeps a person from being able to breathe. Police had previously said Dilly's parents had taken away his phone at the time of his disappearance, which may have upset him. ""In the past, when [he and his family] have a conflict in the residence, Harley will go away for the night,"" Hickman had said previously, adding that they weren't initially concerned at having not heard from him since they had his phone.

"State Department officials say they will raise concerns with Egypt over the ""tragic and avoidable"" death of an American citizen who had been detained for more than six years. New York City resident Moustafa Kassem was arrested amid political upheaval in Egypt during a trip to visit family in August 2013, NPR reports. His lawyers say that after a liquids-only hunger strike that started last year, Kassem stopped taking liquids on Thursday. Relatives say the 54-year-old was arrested for no good reason after going to a shopping mall to change money. He was held in pretrial detention for more than five years before he was sentenced to 15 years in prison following a mass trial involving hundreds of defendants. Kassem, who had a wife and two children, died on Monday.""His death in custody was needless, tragic, and avoidable,"" State Department official David Schenke said Monday, per Reuters. Relatives say Kassem was not involved in politics and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was arrested days before he was due to return to the US. His brother-in-law, Mustafa Ahmed, wrote in the New York Times after Kassem was sentenced in 2018 that when they were stopped by soldiers, Kassem produced his US passport. ""Moustafa saw his blue passport as a shield, his bulletproof armor, which carried the protection and the force of the United States government behind it,"" he wrote—but an enraged soldier called Kassem a spy and arrested him.

"A man who died in an Australian hospital was the 20th casualty of the New Zealand volcano eruption more than a month ago, officials said Monday. The victim was one of three Australians transferred to the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, after the Dec. 9 eruption at White Island. A police statement confirmed the man, whose name has not been released, died on Sunday night as a result of injuries from the eruption, the AP reports. A hospital statement said the man had been critically ill. The hospital is continuing to give specialized burn care to the two other patients transferred there. One is in critical condition and the other is in stable condition, the hospital said.White Island, also known by its Maori name, Whakaari, is the tip of an undersea volcano about 30 miles off New Zealand’s North Island and was a popular tourist destination before the eruption. Many of those killed and injured were from the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Ovation of the Seas. Many people have questioned why tourists were still allowed on the island after New Zealand's GeoNet seismic monitoring agency raised the volcano’s alert level on Nov. 18 from 1 to 2 on a scale where 5 represents a major eruption, noting an increase in sulfur dioxide gas, which originates from magma. New Zealand authorities are investigating the circumstances around the disaster.

"A drumming rock legend has died.

The Canadian band, made up of fellow members Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, announced his death Friday afternoon on social media ""with broken hearts and the deepest sadness,"" asking fans who wanted to help to make a donation to a cancer charity or research group. Peart was also behind much of the lyrics for the band's songs—which NBC News notes were ""heavily influenced by science fiction, philosophy, and classic literature""—and was known for the elaborate drum and percussion setup that surrounded him as he performed.Peart started drumming as a teen after getting ""a pair of sticks, a practice pad, and lessons,"" he said in a 2005 interview. He teamed up with Lee and Lifeson in 1974, and Rush soon attracted a worldwide following, selling millions of records.

"One of the world's largest fish is no more. A new study in the Science of the Total Environment has declared the Chinese paddlefish to be extinct. As National Geographic notes, the freshwater fish had been swimming in the Yangtze River for about 200 million years, but it could not survive the modern surge of China's human population. Overfishing in the 1970s took a toll, but the real damage came with the construction of the Gezhouba Dam on the Yangtze in 1981. It effectively ""split the Chinese paddlefish population in two,"" per Live Science, making it impossible for fish downstream of the dam to return to their spawning grounds. The last sighting came in 2003, though researchers say the fish had been ""functionally extinct,"" or unable to reproduce in meaningful numbers, a decade prior.“It’s very sad,” fish biologist Zeb Hogan of the University of Nevada tells National Geographic. “It’s the definitive loss of a very unique and extraordinary animal, with no hope of recovery.” Hogan was not involved with the study. The fish averaged 10 feet in length, but some specimens clocked in at twice that size, notes Phys.org. The extinction means that only one paddlefish species remains in existence—the American paddlefish, which is found in the Mississippi River Basin and is considered to be vulnerable. Study leader Qiwei Wei of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Science calls the development a ""reprehensible and an irreparable loss."" The study, while leaving open the slim possibility that a stray fish or two exists, calculates that the extinction took place in 2010.

"A staggering one billion animals are now feared dead in Australia's brushfires, but a much smaller group of 10,000 doomed animals is now drawing headlines. On Wednesday, professional shooters in a northwestern portion of South Australia began a five-day aerial cull of up to 10,000 feral camels.

The country's total camel population is thought to number about 1 million—meaning the impacted population represents about 1% of the whole, notes USA Today. As for the country's overall estimated animal death toll, the updated number of one billion came Wednesday from Chris Dickman of the University of Sydney. It represents those animals thought to be lost since September, either as fire victims or creatures who perished upon losing their habitat.

Monday's announcement—meaning layoffs for 300 people, or about 40%, of staff at its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, per Bloomberg—came as the company reported a 13% decline in quarterly sales for a loss of $59 million, reports the New York Times. CEO and CFO Robert Riesbeck said the closures of 450 stores was ""a necessary business decision"" that would ""enable us to move forward with an appropriately sized store footprint and operating structure as an omni-channel retailer.""Still, a bankruptcy plan has been sketched. The company, launched in California in 1962, reported that sales at stores open for at least a year had dropped 11% from the previous year despite new marketing efforts, per CNN. And ""as Pier 1's losses deepen, the planned large-scale store closures and cost cuts will likely be insufficient to turn around the business in time to address the company's looming debt maturities, making restructuring or bankruptcy highly likely scenarios,"" one analyst tells Bloomberg. Shares fell 17% to about $5 with the news. That's down from $300 a share in 2015, per CNN.

"One of the top 10 advertising icons of the 20th century belongs to a company that filed for bankruptcy on Monday. Borden Dairy Co. is following in the footsteps of No. 1 milk producer Dean Foods, which did the same in November. CNN reports the company cited the burden of its debt load and pension obligations in its filing, but also pointed to larger industry issues: a 6% decrease in the amount of milk America has consumed since 2015 and a consistent shrinking of the number of family dairy farms here. As the AP explains, the farms that remain have upped their prices, but Borden hasn't been able to pass that increase on to consumers for fear of getting crushed by competitors like Walmart, which opened a milk processing plant of its own in 2018.""This was our final resort,"" CEO Tony Sarsam told the Washington Post. The company has been in operation for 163 years—since prior to the Civil War. Gail Borden figured out how to condense milk on a commercial scale in 1856, opened a plant five years later in New York, and became a supplier to the Union Army. The company's mascot, Elsie the Cow, entered the public consciousness in 1936. It got the top-10 icon nod from AdAge in 2000. Borden's filing says it will keep operating during the bankruptcy process, but it doesn't share details on its long-term intentions. Numbers-wise, Borden produces almost half-a-billion gallons of milk annually. In 2018 its net sales were $1.2 billion, but it saw a net loss of $14.6 million. The net loss for 2019 through Dec. 7 stood at $42.4 million. (Read more dairy stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/285257/company-that-gave-us-elsie-files-for-bankruptcy.html

"Police in Indiana say a fatal crash on an interstate happened after a trucker took his eyes off the road to set down his coffee mug, reports Fox News. The crash occurred Sunday morning on I-65 when a semi plowed into eight vehicles that had slowed down ahead, says the Boone County Sheriff's Office. One vehicle ended up pinned against a guardrail and caught on fire; its three occupants were declared dead at the scene. They were identified as Mariah Tomey, 21; Kaylee Kirk, 19; and Hadley Tomey, just a year old. Fourteen people were injured.The truck's driver, 34-year-old Mathew Lewis Small, has been charged with three felony charges of reckless homicide, reports the Indianapolis Star. He told authorities that he'd been heading northbound when he looked to set down his mug and then crashed into the slowing vehicles.

"More than 30 animals perished in a zoo fire early New Year's Day, and German police now say three suspects have emerged and taken responsibility. After reports circulated that police suspected sky lanterns may have caused the inferno that destroyed the Krefeld Zoo's ape house, cops say a 60-year-old woman and her two adults daughters came forward to say they'd released such lanterns on New Year's Eve and were ""infinitely sorry"" for what had happened, Deutsche Welle reports. The lanterns, small paper balloons with air heated by fire, are typically seen in Asian celebrations but are illegal in Germany. The dead animals include apes, monkeys, fruit bats, and birds, per CTV News.Police rep Gerd Hoppmann says the women—who appeared to be ""completely normal people who seemed very sensible, very responsible""—told cops they ordered five of the lanterns off the internet and didn't know they were illegal in Germany. Hoppmann adds it was ""courageous"" of them to come forward. Just one lantern is believed to have caused the blaze, though the other four were also found, with handwritten messages for the new year inside. Police are also looking to see if anything else contributed to the blaze, such as dry leaves on the roof of the ape house, which didn't have fire detectors or sprinklers. The women, who are being investigated for negligent arson, face a prison sentence of up to five years if convicted.

"Those devastated to learn of the likely deaths of thousands of koalas in Australia's wildfires should take a deep breath. Ecologists from the University of Sydney now estimate some 480 million animals have been killed since September, per News.com.au. The outlet notes the figure is ""likely to soar"" following fires in recent days, which raised the human death toll to 17, per the Guardian. Environment Minister Sussan Ley says the true toll on animals won't be known until ""the fires have calmed down and a proper assessment can be made."" But with some 10 million acres burned across five states, hope isn't high, per Reuters. ""The fires have burned so hot and so fast that there has been significant mortality of animals in the trees,"" Nature Conservation Council ecologist Mark Graham told Parliament as part of an inquiry into deaths of slow-moving koalas, per News.com.au.""There is such a big area now that is still on fire ... that we will probably never find the bodies,"" Graham added.

"After an effort that spanned 1,400 square miles over 20 hours, the Coast Guard has suspended its search for survivors from a crabbing boat that sank in gale-force winds in the Gulf of Alaska on New Year's Eve. The Coast Guard says two ""extremely hypothermic"" members of the Scandies Rose's seven-man crew were found in a life raft around 2am Wednesday, almost four hours after a mayday call was received from the boat, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Rescuers say they found an empty life raft but no other survivors amid high swells and almost zero visibility in waters. The two rescued men were wearing survival suits. They said they were the only ones who had been able to make it to a raft. The men were hospitalized in stable condition.The Coast Guard said it suspended the search, which involved four helicopter crews, two airplane crews, and a Coast Guard cutter, after ""careful consideration of survival probability."" ""Pretty much every variable weighed against"" finding the two who were rescued, says Lt. Kevin Knaup, co-pilot of a plane used in the rescue. The boat was on its way to the Bering Sea for a new season of crab fishing. The crew was highly experienced, the Seattle Times reports. ""The Scandies is a 130-foot battle ax, and always has been well respected,"" says crabber Dylan Hatfield. The Alaska crab fishery, documented in The Deadliest Catch, has introduced numerous safety improvements over the last 20 years and there were no fatalities for an 11-year period before a fishing vessel and its six crew disappeared in early 2017.

"Taiwan's top military official was among eight people killed in an air force helicopter crash in mountainous terrain outside Taipei on Thursday, the defense ministry said. Five others survived. As chief of the general staff, Gen. Shen Yi-ming was responsible for overseeing the self-governing island's defense against China, which threatens to use military force if necessary to annex what it considers part of its territory. The helicopter was flying from Taipei to the nearby city of Yilan for a New Year's activity when it crashed, the AP reports. The victims included other senior military officials and the two pilots. The UH-60M Blackhawk with 13 people on board dropped from the radar screen 10 minutes after takeoff from Songshan air force base around 7:50am, Taiwan's defense ministry said.It went down in the mountainous, heavily forested Wulai area southeast of the capital. Shen, 63, had taken over as chief of the general staff in July after serving as commander of Taiwan’s air force. The loss of Shen and other high-ranking officials will require a rapid reshuffle of positions, but should have minimal effect on Taiwan's Jan. 11 elections for president and lawmakers, said Andrew Yang, a former deputy defense minister who said Shen was highly respected throughout his career.

"David Stern, the basketball-loving lawyer who took the NBA around the world during 30 years as its longest-serving commissioner and oversaw its growth into a global powerhouse, died Wednesday, the AP reports. He was 77. Stern suffered a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 12 and underwent emergency surgery. The league said he died with his wife, Dianne, and their family at his bedside. ""The entire basketball community is heartbroken,"" the National Basketball Players Association said. ""David Stern earned and deserved inclusion in our land of giants."" Stern had been involved with the NBA for nearly 20 years before he became commissioner on Feb. 1, 1984. When he left in 2014, the NBA had become a $5 billion-plus industry, second perhaps only to soccer in worldwide popularity.""Because of David, the NBA is a truly global brand,"" said Adam Silver, who followed Stern as commissioner and called him ""one of the most influential business leaders of his generation."" Thriving on good debate in the boardroom and good games in the arena, Stern would say one of his greatest achievements was guiding a league of mostly black players that was plagued by drug problems in the 1970s to popularity with mainstream America. He had a hand in nearly every initiative to do that, from the drug testing program, to the implementation of the salary cap, to the creation of a dress code.

"A fire at a zoo in western Germany in the first minutes of 2020 killed more than 30 animals, including apes, monkeys, bats and birds, authorities said. Police said the fire may have been caused by sky lanterns launched to celebrate the new year, the AP reports. Witnesses reported that they had seen the cylindrical paper lanterns with little fires inside flying in the night sky shortly after midnight near the Krefeld zoo, Gerd Hoppmann, the city's head of criminal police told reporters Wednesday, just before the zoo began to burn. Police and firefighters received the first emergency calls at 12:38am. The zoo near the Dutch border said that the ape house burned down and more than 30 animals, including five orangutans, two gorillas, a chimpanzee and several monkeys, as well as fruit bats and birds, were killed. Only two chimpanzees could be rescued, zoo director Wolfgang Dressen said.""It's close to a miracle that Bally, a 40-year-old female chimpanzee, and Limbo, a younger male, survived this inferno,"" Dressen said, adding that many animal handlers were in shock at the devastation. ""We have to seriously work through the mourning process. This is an unfathomable tragedy."" The zoo director also said many of the dead animals were close to extinction in the wild. Police said that the use of sky lanterns is illegal in Krefeld and most other parts of Germany and that their use is uncommon. Sky lanterns, sometimes called Chinese lanterns, are a sort of hot-air balloon made of paper. They have been used in Asia for celebratory events for centuries. Hoppmann said investigators found used lanterns on the ground that hadn't burned entirely. They were 13.4 inches long, made out of white paper with an opening at the bottom where a small fire would have been suspended. The fire heats the air inside, making them fly and shine at night.

"One day in May 1970, an 11-year-old boy and his sister waited outside a Chicago tavern for their mom to come out. When a priest happened by and offered the family a ride home, they took him up on it. The boy, Robert Goldberg, would pay dearly for the favor, enduring what he describes as years of psychological control and sexual abuse he suffered while working as a child valet for the late Rev. Donald J. McGuire. He remained in the Jesuit’s thrall for nearly 40 years, even testifying on McGuire's behalf during criminal trials that resulted in a 25-year prison sentence for the priest. Now, however, Goldberg, 61, is telling his story, to the AP and in a suit he filed Monday in San Francisco. The suit charges that McGuire, a globe-trotting Jesuit with ties to Mother Teresa, abused Goldberg “more than 1,000 times, in multiple states and countries,” during sojourns to spiritual retreats in the US and Europe.On these trips, the suit says, Goldberg carried McGuire's briefcase, ran errands, and often endured daily abuse that included ""sexual touching, oral copulation, and anal penetration."" The complaint doesn't currently name any defendants, but Goldberg's attorneys say the defendants will include the Jesuit religious order in the US and the order's top leader in Rome, among others. They also say Goldberg’s abuse occurred at a time when powerful church officials—including Mother Teresa, who was eventually elevated to sainthood by Pope Francis—knew McGuire had been repeatedly accused of sexually abusing boys. Church officials went to great lengths to cover up his crimes, the suit alleges. Goldberg was often tearful as he told his story. ""I have to forgive him, so I can get into heaven,"" he said.

"As the ESPN family continues to mourn Ed Aschoff, who died on his 34th birthday on Christmas Eve, the reporter's fiancee took to Twitter with a touching, image-filled tribute. Tweeting from Aschoff's account, Katy Berteau thanked everyone for their support, noting ""it has brought me brief moments of joy in this darkness to see all the pictures, videos, and memories of all the lives he touched."" Berteau also used the tweet thread to clarify what had happened to the man ESPN says she was set to marry in April in New Orleans, per CNN Business. She says a week after she and Aschoff had first gone to the ER, where he was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, they were back, with Aschoff experiencing worsening symptoms despite the antibiotics he was taking.More extensive tests were conducted, and Berteau explains that the next round of treatment wasn't for pneumonia, but for a rare condition doctors believed Aschoff was suffering from called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or HLH, which can be brought on in adults by an infection and cause one's immune system to not work properly. Despite the medical staff's efforts, Aschoff died three days after he was placed in the ICU. Still, Berteau reveals he was upbeat until the very end. ""He kept the doctors and nurses constantly laughing, and always made a point to thank them and tell them what a great job they were doing,"" she posts, adding that he even made sure to arrange from his hospital bed for Berteau's Christmas presents to be wrapped.

"Four people found dead Wednesday in a home in an Albuquerque suburb were members of the same family, and the case is being investigated as a murder-suicide, authorities said Thursday. ""This is a tragic event for the family and for the people in our communities. Our officers and detectives understand the impact this incident has on our entire city,"" Capt. Andrew Rodriguez said in the statement. Rose Varona told KRQE that she’s related to the people who lived at the home and that her brother and mother found the bodies. She said the family of four that lived at the home stayed up late Tuesday to celebrate Christmas Eve. Varona said relatives on Wednesday started to become worried because they had not heard from the family, so her mother and brother went to the home and discovered the bodies.""We just try to draw the strength from God, even though we don’t understand what’s going on,” Varona said.

"The rector of Notre Dame Cathedral says the Paris landmark is still so fragile that there's a “50% chance” it might not be saved, because scaffolding installed before the April fire is threatening the Gothic monument's vaults. Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said restoration work isn't likely to begin until 2021—and described his ""heartache"" that Notre Dame couldn't hold Christmas services this year, for the first time since the French Revolution. ""It is not out of danger,"" he told the AP. ""It will be out of danger when we take out the remaining scaffolding. Today we can say that there is maybe a 50% chance that it will be saved. There is also 50% chance of scaffolding falling onto the three vaults, so ... the building is still very fragile."" The 12th-century cathedral was under renovation at the time of the April fire, which destroyed its roof and collapsed its spire. With no roof to keep the massive stone structure stable, the cathedral's surviving vaults are crucial to keeping it standing, but they are vulnerable.Some 50,000 tubes of scaffolding crisscrossed the back of the edifice at the time of the fire, and some were damaged. Removing them without causing further problems is one of the toughest parts of the cleanup effort. “We need to remove completely the scaffolding in order to make the building safe, so in 2021 we will probably start the restoration of the cathedral,” Chauvet said. “Once the scaffolding is removed we need to assess the state of the cathedral, the quantity of stones to be removed and replaced."" Chauvet estimated it would take another three years to make it safe enough for people, but that the full restoration will take longer. President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants it rebuilt by 2024, when Paris hosts the Olympics, but experts have questioned whether that time frame is realistic. But its congregation, clergy, and choir are keeping its spirit alive, and decamped Christmas celebrations to the Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois Church.(Read more Notre Dame Cathedral stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/284794/notre-dame-rector-50-chance-it-can-be-saved.html

"The body of a missing pregnant Texas woman has been found, and cops say her younger brother has confessed to killing her. The Dallas Morning News reports 19-year-old Eduardo Arevalo has been charged with capital murder in the death of his 23-year-old sister, Viridiana Arevalo, who was eight months pregnant. Her body was found Sunday in an alley in The Colony, and cops say evidence there and other information led them to suspect Eduardo Arevalo. Per an arrest affidavit cited by the Morning News and NBC FW, Arevalo admitted to the crime, saying his sister was an ""embarrassment"" to their family, and that on Dec. 16, after they'd gotten into an argument, he went to his room and thought, ""Maybe it's the time to murder her."" He then told police he went into the living room, came up from behind where his sister was sitting on the couch, and strangled her with his arm, the affidavit says.""I murdered her, I murdered her,"" cops say he told them, adding that he also admitted to driving her body to a field about 40 miles away and dumping it there, before going back to retrieve it a week later so he could leave it in the alleyway about a mile from their home, reportedly because he wanted his family to get closure in finding her body. Another brother tells CBS News he can't fathom his younger brother doing such a thing. ""I know my brother,"" Diego Arevalo says. ""He wouldn't do something like this."" Cops also say Eduardo Arevalo staged his sister's death to look like a suicide. He's being held in The Colony Jail, with bail set at $1,050,000. The New York Post notes that, due to the capital murder charge—which was brought because Viridiana Arevalo was pregnant—Eduardo Arevalo could face life in prison without parole or the death penalty if convicted.

"Katie Golden was a fan of Titan Goodson, but she seemed to mostly be alone in that department. The Florida 17-year-old's parents disliked him, writing him off as a bad influence on the college-bound cheerleader. The grandparents he lived with thought he might be doing drugs and planned to force him out of the home once he turned 18. But the two had dated all the same. They weren't dating when she overdosed on April 15, 2017—she was taken off life support three days later. But they were together in a Tampa condo and had been doing heroin, details that will be heard at Goodson's March trial for manslaughter. At the Tampa Bay Times, Dan Sullivan writes that ""a criminal charge for an accidental overdose is unusual,"" though it's slowly becoming less so.Prosecutors allege Goodson supplied the drugs and didn't take sufficient action to save Golden once she overdosed; he told detectives they had snorted heroin around 8pm the night before, and he woke up four hours later to discover he couldn't rouse her. He said he called his father, a known heroin user, and followed his advice to ice her down. He noted an improvement but awoke at 5:30am to find her not breathing and called 911. ""She's dead. She's been dead for ... hours,"" he cried. His defense counters that it was an accident and that Golden was a ""junkie"" (she had been to rehab, though her parents didn't know she used heroin) who supplied the drugs that day, something Goodson has maintained since that first police interview.

Broussard disappeared Dec. 12 along with her 1-month-old daughter after dropping her 6-year-old son off at school; a healthy baby that looks like the missing infant was found at the same Houston house where Broussard's body was found, but DNA test results are still confirming her identification.

"An arrest has been made in the case of missing Texas mom Heidi Broussard after a body believed to be hers was found Thursday evening at a home near Houston. An infant girl was also found at the Jersey Village residence, thought to be Broussard's daughter, Margot Carey. The Austin Police Department, which says the healthy baby is in the care of Child Protective Services, notes her DNA is being tested to see if she is little Margot, per KXAN. Broussard's mother says cops told her the body found in the trunk of a car at the home was likely her daughter, reports NBC News. An autopsy is being conducted for confirmation. The suspect now in custody and being held on $600,000 bond is 33-year-old Magen Rose Fieramusca, and police say she was a ""close friend"" with Broussard, who was from Austin. More on this developing case:A gruesome scheme? Law enforcement officials say Fieramusca, who's so far been charged with kidnapping and tampering with evidence (a corpse), had faked being pregnant over the past several months and plotted to take Broussard's baby, per the Austin American-Statesman.

"Texas mom Heidi Broussard and her weeks-old daughter haven't been seen since the morning of Dec. 12, when the 33-year-old dropped her 6-year-old son off at an Austin elementary school. Now, there appears to be a tragic development after police and FBI agents descended upon a home in Harris County Thursday evening. ABC13 was on the scene when it says dozens of law enforcement officials entered the residence near Jersey Village. The outlet reports a one-month-old girl was retrieved alive from the home and taken by ambulance to a hospital; the medical examiner's office also reportedly removed a body.Broussard's mother, Tammy Broussard, tells NBC News that cops told her a body found in a car trunk is likely her daughter, though official verification is still needed. She says police also told her that granddaughter Margot Carey is in good condition. Although the FBI did confirm it was on the premises at the home in question, it didn't elaborate; Austin police, also said to have been on the scene with officers from the Texas Rangers and Department of Public Safety, didn't respond to requests for comment. Heidi Broussard's boyfriend, Shane Carey, who's also Margot's father, says he came home on Dec. 12 to find Broussard's car there, but not her or the baby.

"A heartbreaking new study links UN peacekeepers to hundreds of children fathered in Haiti and abandoned to struggle in poverty, the New York Times reports. The peacekeepers—from over a dozen countries, but mostly Brazil and Uruguay—often gave food or money in exchange for sex, the study says, and shirked all responsibility when their mission ended. ""They put a few coins in your hands to drop a baby in you,"" a Haitian told researchers. Among the 2,500 Haitians interviewed, just over 10% told such stories without any prompting. ""The child is growing up, and it's myself and my family that are struggling with him,"" one mother said. ""I now have to send him to school. They put him out because I'm unable to pay for it.""Haitian lawyers took action, filing paternity suits for 10 such children, but they say UN officials did nothing. Among the most scathing responses: ""This research confirms that standard UN practice is to exploit women ... and then squash them like bugs if they dare complain about sexual abuse and threaten the UN patriarchy's 75-year-old culture of entitlement and impunity,"" says Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free World. A UN Peacekeeping rep tells the Times of London that efforts are underway to ""end and prevent these abuses"" but that ""much remains to be done."" It's another black eye for the 2004-2017 peacekeeping effort, which has been linked to the killing of civilians and the introduction of cholera, which killed over 10,000 people in Haiti and sickened over 800,000 more.

"Every McDonald's in Peru shut down for two days this week to mourn two teen workers who died while working a night shift over the weekend. The bodies of 18-year-old Gabriel Campos Zapata and Alexandra Porras Inga, 19, were found by emergency workers in the Lima restaurant Sunday morning. It appears the two were electrocuted, though exactly how is still murky: The New York Times reports the two were electrocuted by a loose cable, while, per the BBC and Guardian, cops say Porras Inga received an electric shock from a beverage machine, and Campos Zapata was killed when he tried to help her. Porras Inga's family thinks she may have been shocked while washing the floor: The teen's mother tells the Times that after she got a phone call telling her Porras Inga had died, she rushed to the restaurant and could see her daughter's body on a wet floor, with loose cables nearby.""We share the sorrow and extreme pain of the affected families,"" Arcos Dorados, the firm that operates McDonald's franchises in much of Latin America, said in a statement announcing the nationwide closure.

"The riskiest part of their exchange wasn't the photo she sent him that revealed a bit of her bra. It was that it happened at all. In a lengthy piece for Wired, Vince Beiser shares the story of Jared Johns, a Army vet living in South Carolina who seemed to be turning his life around after things essentially fell apart following a career-ending injury in Afghanistan. But then he traded a few lines with ""Caroline Harris"" on a dating site. She sent him that photo and said she was about to turn 18. He replied ""cool,"" and asked when. She said her birthday was a few weeks later—Sept. 15, 2018—and asked his age. ""Oh ok are you still in high school? And I'm 24."" That was the end of that—until he got a phone call from a man who said he was a police detective. The ""detective"" said Caroline's parents had accused Johns of sexually propositioning a minor and wanted him arrested.He gave Johns the Harris' number so he could try to work things out; Johns called and spoke with ""James Harris."" He threatened jail time unless Johns paid $1,189 to cover the cost of his daughter's cell contract, which the Harrises said had been canceled to punish their daughter. Johns Googled the detective's number, and it matched that of a police department. He was distraught and told Lisa, a woman he was seeing, about it. She tried to reassure him he hadn't crossed any line. But he kept texting the Harrises and getting threatened with police involvement. Less than 48 hours after that initial phone call, Johns killed himself—and Lisa told his family what had transpired. What they discovered: there was no Caroline. It was all a scam, and one that was allegedly orchestrated by two inmates at Lee Correctional Institution in South Carolina.

"Anna Karina, the French New Wave actress who became an icon of the cinema in the 1960s and was the muse of Jean-Luc Godard, has died. She was 79. The French culture minister announced her death on Twitter on Sunday. French media said that the Danish-born Karina had cancer and died Saturday. ""Her look was the look of the New Wave. It will remain so forever,'' Culture Minister Franck Riester tweeted. ""Anna Karina radiated. She magnetized the entire world,"" he added, and grieved that ""French cinema has lost one of its legends.'' Karina made seven films with Godard, her partner at the time, including the 1961 Une Femme Est Une Femme (A Woman is a Woman), in which she played a femme fatale. For that, she received the best actress award at the Berlin Film Festival.Other cult Godard movies starring Karina included the 1962 Vivre Sa Vie (Live Your Life) and the 1965 Pierrot Le Fou. Karina captured film-goers with her large blue doe eyes and acting and singing talents. The French New Wave broke with traditional cinematic conventions to create a fresh approach to making movies, in keeping with the free-spirited times. Born Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer in Denmark, she initially modeled and sang in cabarets before coming to France. She was reportedly discovered, and renamed, by Coco Chanel, then discovered by Godard. Karina also worked, among other illustrious directors, with Luchino Visconti. In a bold undertaking at the time, the actress later got behind the camera to make her own movie in 1973, Vivre Ensemble (Living Together).",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/284389/cinematic-icon-is-dead-at-79.html

"A family that begged a Texas judge to keep a 10-month-old baby on life support has gotten its wish—at least for a few more weeks. The AP reports Judge Sandee Bryan Marion extended an injunction Thursday to keep Tinslee Lewis on life support at Fort Worth's Cook Children's Medical Center through Jan. 2, to give the judge time to do more research so she can make a final ruling. Tinslee has been hospitalized there since her premature February birth and suffers from severe high blood pressure, chronic lung disease, and a rare heart defect. She needs full cardiac and respiratory support and is deeply sedated, though she's conscious, her family tells the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The hospital's ethics committee decided in October that nothing more could be done for Tinslee and that she should be taken off life support, jump-starting a legal battle between the medical center and Tinslee's family.The hospital originally planned to take Tinslee off life support on Nov. 10, citing the state's ""10-day rule"": It says if a patient's family disagrees with doctors and a hospital's ethics committee on whether to keep life-sustaining treatment going, the hospital can cease that treatment if a new provider can't be found within 10 days. In a statement to CBS 11, Cook Children's says ""more than 20"" providers turned down Tinslee's case. The family's lawyer says Boston Children's Hospital is reconsidering its decision.

"Two suspects charged with capital murder and kidnapping in the death of a 3-year-old girl in Alabama are each pointing the finger at the other. At Tuesday's preliminary hearing for Patrick Stallworth, defense attorney Derrick Collins said his client had initially lied to authorities out of love for his girlfriend, Derick Brown, who was solely responsible, reports AL.com. Collins has previously said 29-year-old Brown, who led authorities to Kamille McKinney's remains in a dumpster at an apartment complex, implicated Stallworth, 39. Lead homicide detective Jonathan Ross testified that the pair were together as Stallworth bought $19 worth of candy near Tom Brown Village apartments in Birmingham, the complex from which Kamille disappeared, on the day of her abduction, Oct. 12. Five minutes later, Ross said, the couple offered candy to two preteen girls walking by, with Stallworth telling one, ""I'm looking for a girl that looks like you.""Other child witnesses also told police the couple was driving around the complex giving out candy and that Kamille got into a vehicle matching Stallworth's SUV, per WNCN. An autopsy showed she died of asphyxiation by suffocation after ingesting a toxic amount of methamphetamine and Trazodone, an anti-depressant used to treat insomnia, for which Stallworth had a prescription. But Stallworth—who was seen buying a pill for erectile dysfunction after leaving Tom Brown Village—told police that Brown had been stealing his Trazodone. Stallworth further claimed Brown kidnapped Kamille without his knowledge, then killed the child after he refused her request to ""do something sexual"" to the girl, Ross said. DNA belonging to all three was found on a mattress cover in the apartment, along with blood, Ross added. Collins said Kamille's body showed no evidence of sexual assault, though prosecutors argue decomposition was a factor. Brown's preliminary hearing is set for Friday.

"Six people—a police officer, two suspects, and three bystanders—have been confirmed dead after a shootout in Jersey City on Tuesday. Police say the shooting began outside a cemetery, when the two suspects killed Detective Joseph Seals before speeding off in a rental van that had been reported stolen, the New York Times reports. The two gunmen then entered a kosher supermarket in a Hasidic neighborhood, where they engaged police in a shootout.

"Two suspects charged with capital murder and kidnapping in the death of a 3-year-old girl in Alabama are each pointing the finger at the other. At Tuesday's preliminary hearing for Patrick Stallworth, defense attorney Derrick Collins said his client had initially lied to authorities out of love for his girlfriend, Derick Brown, who was solely responsible, reports AL.com. Collins has previously said 29-year-old Brown, who led authorities to Kamille McKinney's remains in a dumpster at an apartment complex, implicated Stallworth, 39. Lead homicide detective Jonathan Ross testified that the pair were together as Stallworth bought $19 worth of candy near Tom Brown Village apartments in Birmingham, the complex from which Kamille disappeared, on the day of her abduction, Oct. 12. Five minutes later, Ross said, the couple offered candy to two preteen girls walking by, with Stallworth telling one, ""I'm looking for a girl that looks like you.""Other child witnesses also told police the couple was driving around the complex giving out candy and that Kamille got into a vehicle matching Stallworth's SUV, per WNCN. An autopsy showed she died of asphyxiation by suffocation after ingesting a toxic amount of methamphetamine and Trazodone, an anti-depressant used to treat insomnia, for which Stallworth had a prescription. But Stallworth—who was seen buying a pill for erectile dysfunction after leaving Tom Brown Village—told police that Brown had been stealing his Trazodone. Stallworth further claimed Brown kidnapped Kamille without his knowledge, then killed the child after he refused her request to ""do something sexual"" to the girl, Ross said. DNA belonging to all three was found on a mattress cover in the apartment, along with blood, Ross added. Collins said Kamille's body showed no evidence of sexual assault, though prosecutors argue decomposition was a factor. Brown's preliminary hearing is set for Friday.

"Six people—a police officer, two suspects, and three bystanders—have been confirmed dead after a shootout in Jersey City on Tuesday. Police say the shooting began outside a cemetery, when the two suspects killed Detective Joseph Seals before speeding off in a rental van that had been reported stolen, the New York Times reports. The two gunmen then entered a kosher supermarket in a Hasidic neighborhood, where they engaged police in a shootout. Authorities initially said the incident was not terror-related, but Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted Tuesday night that based on the initial investigation, ""we now believe the active shooters targeted the location they attacked."" The gunmen have not been identified.Police say the bodies of the two gunmen were found inside the kosher market, along with the bodies of three people who were either employees or customers.

"Search crews are combing the Antarctic for a Chilean military transport plane carrying 38 people that vanished en route to a base on the frozen continent and will tirelessly press ahead as the hunt gains widening international support, officials say. Gen. Eduardo Mosqueira says Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the US had each lent planes to the search following Monday's disappearance. At least 13 aircraft and several ships were scouring the area where the plane was believed to be when radio contact was lost. ""We’ll continue searching 24 hours a day, both night and day,"" Mosqueira tells the AP. The aircraft would have been about halfway to the Antarctic base when it lost contact, he says, adding that no emergency signals had been activated.On Tuesday, crews encountered low visibility and waves up to 20 feet high. Officials say the plane took off in favorable conditions Monday afternoon, though it was flying in an area notorious for rapidly changing conditions, with freezing temperatures and strong winds. Seven hours after contact was cut off, the air force declared the plane a loss, though there was no sign of what happened to it. The C-130 Hercules carried 17 crew members and 21 passengers, including three civilians. They were en route to check on a floating fuel supply line and other equipment at the Chilean base. Holding out hope of survivors, officials said the plane was equipped with four rafts that could hold up to 20 passengers each if it went down at sea.(Read more Antarctica stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/284205/search-crews-comb-antarctic-for-missing-plane.html

"Pete Frates, a former college baseball player whose determined battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease made him, per CBS Boston, ""the face of"" the ALS ice bucket challenge that has raised more than $200 million worldwide, died Monday, the AP reports. He was 34. Frates died peacefully, surrounded by his family, they said in a statement. “A natural born leader and the ultimate teammate, Pete was a role model for all, especially young athletes, who looked up to him for his bravery and unwavering positive spirit in the face of adversity,"" the family said. “He was a noble fighter who inspired us all to use our talents and strengths in the service of others."" The ice bucket challenge began in 2014 when pro golfer Chris Kennedy challenged his wife’s cousin Jeanette Senerchia, whose husband has ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the New York Yankees great who suffered from it.ALS patient Pat Quinn, of Yonkers, New York, picked up on it and started its spread, but when Frates and his family got involved, the phenomenon exploded on social media. Thousands of people participated, including celebrities, sports stars and politicians—even Donald Trump before his election and cartoon character Homer Simpson. Online videos were viewed millions of times. “The ALS ice bucket challenge represents all that’s great about this country—it’s about fun, friends, family, and it makes a difference to all of us living with ALS,” Frates said at the time. The challenge has raised about $220 million worldwide, including $115 million alone for the Washington-based ALS Association.

"Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who in the early 1980s raised interest rates to historic highs and triggered a recession as the price of quashing double-digit inflation, has died. He was 92, per the AP. The New York Times and Washington Post report his death was confirmed by his daughter, Janice Zima, who tells the Post his death was due to complications from prostate cancer. Volcker took charge of the Fed in August 1979, when the US economy was slipping into the grip of runaway inflation, the AP notes. Consumer prices skyrocketed 13% in 1979, and then by the same amount in 1980. The 6-foot-7-inch Volcker, who the Times notes had a ""reputation for austere integrity,"" worked relentlessly to bring prices under control. He pushed the Fed’s benchmark interest rate from 11% to a record 20% by late 1980 to try to slow the economy’s growth and shrink inflation.Those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily. By January 1980, a recession had begun, which lasted six months. A deeper downturn took hold in July 1981, enduring for 18 months and sending unemployment up to 10.8%, the highest since the Great Depression. In the midst of it, Volcker was vilified by the public. But the pain eventually paid off, and inflation receded. Once it did, Volcker’s Fed began lowering interest rates, and the economy bounded back. After the 2008 financial crisis, President Obama recruited Volcker as an adviser. Volcker pressed for regulations on banks that became known as the Volcker Rule, and were included in a far-reaching financial overhaul bill Congress passed in 2010.

"René Auberjonois, a prolific actor best known for his roles on the television shows Benson and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and his part in the 1970 film M.A.S.H. playing Father Mulcahy, has died. He was 79. The actor died Sunday at his home in Los Angeles of metastatic lung cancer, his son Rèmy-Luc Auberjonois told the AP. René Auberjonois worked constantly as a character actor in several golden ages, from the dynamic theater of the 1960s to the cinema renaissance of the 1970s to the prime period of network television in the 1980s and '90s—and each generation knew him for something different. For film fans of the 1970s, he was Father John Mulcahy, the military chaplain who played straight man to the doctors' antics in M.A.S.H.""I am all of those characters, and I love that,"" Auberjonois said in a 2011 interview. ""I also run into people, and they think I'm their cousin or their dry cleaner. I love that, too."" Born in New York in 1940, Auberjonois was raised in New York, Paris, and London. After graduating from college, Auberjonois hopped around the country joining theater companies, eventually landing Broadway roles including the Fool in a long-running version of King Lear. The following year he would play Sebastian Baye opposite Katharine Hepburn in Coco, and later saw Tony nominations for 1973's The Good Doctor, 1984's Big River, and 1989's City of Angels.

"Police in St. Louis County, Mo., had several reasons to be suspicious of Beau Rothwell after his 28-year-old wife went missing in mid-November—chief among them that he refused to give a DNA sample or let cops search his car, home, or cellphone, reports the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Another disturbing detail, per search warrants cited by the newspaper: Jennifer Rothwell was six weeks pregnant and had carried out a search on her cellphone for ""what to do if your husband is upset you are pregnant."" Rothwell, also 28, reported his wife missing on Nov. 12; on Nov. 13, police searched the Rothwell home, finding an ""overwhelming"" smell of bleach inside, splatters of blood someone tried to clean with detergent (and later found to be Jennifer Rothwell's), and windows open in the home and garage and a fan blowing, despite frigid temps.Police also say surveillance footage shows Beau Rothwell buying paper towels and rubber gloves at a store on Nov. 11; cops say they found those items in a trash can outside the home on Nov. 13, as well as a store receipt. ""This purchase was oddly at a time during a major snow event involving dangerous driving conditions, and was also contradictory to Beau Rothwell's statement that he was home with his wife all night"" on Nov. 11, the warrants say. Beau Rothwell was charged on Nov. 14, and authorities say he told them where to find his wife's body, which they discovered on Nov. 18 in a wooded area near Troy.

Officers responding to a 911 call found 16-year-old Sterling Jette Jr. inside the Watertown home and 15-year-old Della Jette on a back deck, both with gunshot wounds to the chest. They died shortly after arriving at a hospital, while the alleged shooter—Jette's boyfriend of two years, Paul Ferguson—died at the scene of what is believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reports ABC News. Ferguson, 42, had been living with the family for two weeks when an argument erupted over his habit of smoking indoors. Danielle Jette told police Ferguson grabbed a Glock handgun stored in a bedroom, then shot Sterling in the leg when he tried to intervene.""The mother went downstairs to call 911 when she heard a second gunshot presumably when he shot the daughter on the deck,"" says Watertown Police Chief John Gavallas. ""He came back into the house and shot the son in the chest"" before barricading himself in a bedroom. Ferguson—convicted of first-degree unlawful restraint in 2007, per CNN—was barred from possessing a firearm; it's unclear who owned the gun. ""This mother is completely distraught as you can imagine,"" Gavallas says, per NBC Connecticut. ""She was shocked. Absolutely shocked."" So are friends of the teens. Both Della and Sterling had argued with Ferguson before, but ""it would never be anything serious"" and ""there was never any violence involved,"" Sterling's girlfriend tells NBC. ""Now he's with his dad,"" she adds of Sterling. ""He doesn't have to miss his dad anymore.""

"Pat Sullivan, a revered figure in Alabama sports, died Sunday at age 69. The Heisman Trophy winner had a varied career but was best known for his years as a college football quarterback and coach—and his optimism in the face of cancer, 247 Sports recalls. ""I was blessed,"" he said in 2016. ""...I've said it many, many times, and I believe it: What you get out of athletics is the relationships that last for a lifetime.""

He went on to be drafted by the Atlanta Falcons but started only four games over a four-year pro career that ended with the Washington Redskins in 1976.After working in the insurance and tire industries in Birmingham—and doing Auburn radio analysis—he took his wife's advice and followed his heart. ""It was the summer of 1985, right before the season,"" he says. ""She said, 'You don’t want to wake up when you are 50 and not be doing what you want to do.'"" So he joined the Tigers as quarterbacks coach in 1986, helping the team win four consecutive Iron Bowls, and became TCU head coach in 1992, racking up a 24-42-1 record through 1997. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1991, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. His 2003 mouth cancer diagnosis and treatments were difficult, but he stayed in football and remained head coach at Samford University until 2014, posting a winning record over eight seasons.

"For the first time, an Indiana man accused of negligent homicide after his 18-month-old granddaughter fell to her death from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship is speaking publicly. In an interview with CBS News, Salvatore Anello recalls to David Begnaud what happened on that July day in Puerto Rico, when, according to his account, he was holding little Chloe Wiegand up to knock on a window on the Freedom of the Seas, as they often did at hockey games. Except the window was open, and Chloe fell out of Anello's grasp, plummeting more than 10 stories. In video seen by CBS, which will be used as evidence at Anello's criminal trial, he can be seen hoisting Chloe up and apparently over the railing in front of what he says he thought was a closed window. A few seconds later, Chloe falls. ""I saw her fall, I saw her fall the whole way down,"" he tells Begnaud. ""I was just in disbelief.""He adds, ""For a while I was in shock, I was just standing there. And then I just remember screaming that I thought there was glass. I thought there was glass."" He says he's been told that the fact that he's colorblind may have led him to believe there was glass in front of Chloe. In a July interview, Chloe's mother told Today that Anello has been ""very, very distraught"" since the incident. ""You can barely look at him without him crying,"" Kimberly Weigand said. ""She was his best friend."" The Weigands think the cruise ship is responsible for their daughter's death and are planning to file a lawsuit by the end of the year. Anello, who's due back in court Dec. 17, could face three years behind bars if convicted. He says he doesn't care what happens in his legal proceedings: ""Chloe being gone is the worst thing ever. ... There's nothing worse that they could do to me than what's already happened.""

"An 18-year-old accused of fatally shooting a sheriff in Alabama is the son of another lawman in a neighboring county. Chase Johnson was charged with murder in a brief court appearance Monday, the New York Times reports. Police say the teen, who allegedly shot Sheriff John Williams of Lowndes County at a QV gas station Saturday night, is the son of a deputy at the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. Officials in both counties have declined to name the suspect's father, or say whether he knew Williams.

"A body recovered in Alabama is that of a 5-year-old Florida girl who went missing earlier this month, authorities announced Monday. An Amber Alert for Taylor Rose Williams had been canceled following confirmation of the child’s death, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Chief TK Waters said at a news conference. “We remain committed to working to bring justice for her,” Waters said. Brianna Williams, 27, reported her daughter missing from their Jacksonville home on Nov. 6, but the mother stopped cooperating with detectives after being questioned about inconsistencies in her story, investigators said. Williams is a petty officer at Naval Air Station Jacksonville.Police found human remains Nov. 12 near Williams’ hometown in Demopolis, Alabama, the AP reports. Soon after, Williams was hospitalized for more than a week after trying to kill herself with an apparent overdose, officials said. She was charged with child neglect and providing false information to police and booked into jail immediately after being discharged from the hospital. She’s being held on a $1.1 million bond. She has not been charged with the girl’s death. Arrest documents show a neighbor often saw Taylor alone at their apartment complex. Records show she last attended day care on April 29. Authorities weren’t immediately saying how the girl died.(Read more missing child stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/283540/body-of-missing-girl-5-found.html

"An Alabama district attorney said Monday that authorities have “good reason” to believe human remains found in a wooded area belong to the missing stepdaughter of a UFC heavyweight fighter. The remains were found on a county road in neighboring Macon County, Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes told the AP. “I can confirm that human remains have been found in Macon County on County Road 2 and we have good reason to believe they are that of Aniah Blanchard,” Hughes said. Police arrested a third person Monday in connection with the disappearance of Blanchard, 19, whose stepfather is Walt Harris. She was last seen Oct. 23 in Auburn. After she disappeared, Blanchard’s black Honda CRV was found abandoned more than 50 miles away at an apartment complex in Montgomery, Alabama.Auburn police detective Josh Mixon testified at a hearing last week that Blanchard’s blood was found in the car and it appeared she had suffered a life-threatening injury. Mixon testified that convenience store video footage showed a man buying a beverage look over at Blanchard. He said tipsters later identified the man as Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, and a man at the store told investigators he saw Yazeed force Blanchard into her car and drive away. Police have arrested Yazeed and a second man, 35-year-old Antwain Shamar Fisher of Montgomery, on kidnapping charges in Blanchard’s disappearance. In an arrest warrant filed with the court Monday, police said Fisher helped Yazeed by disposing of evidence and driving him. Hughes said a third man, David Johnson, Jr., was arrested Monday in Montgomery and charged with hindering prosecution in the case.(Read more missing woman stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/283541/remains-of-ufc-fighters-baby-likely-found.html

"A Florida woman and her two grandsons were killed by a passing Amtrak train on Saturday afternoon as she drove the Cub Scouts to an overnight camping trip near West Palm Beach, per the AP. The train carrying some 200 passengers collided with the family’s Subaru Outback at the gateless railroad crossing near the entrance to the JW Corbett Wildlife Management Area, the Palm Beach Post reports. The train dragged the vehicle for a half-mile, killing Valery Jo Rintamaki, 58; Tristan Prestano, 10; and Skyler Prestano, 8. Camping gear was strewn along the tracks. No one on the train was injured. David Peat, the boys' grandfather, tells the paper he was shocked to find no structure preventing a car from unwittingly driving into the path of an oncoming train. Instead, there's a pole with a railroad crossing and yield sign.""There’s no drop-down gates, no lights, no signal,"" he says. Peat, who was the boys' caretaker, took his concerns to a longtime acquaintance, state Rep. Matt Willhite, a Democrat from Wellington, where the family lives. ""We just lost three members of our community, and young kids,"" Willhite says. ""I'm going to look into why we don't have more than just a yield sign at a rail crossing where a train is going [at high speeds]."" The tracks are owned by CSX Transportation. Peat says the boys enjoyed the outdoors and loved to ride dirt bikes and fish.

"He was the only survivor of a murder-suicide shooting that claimed the lives of his mother and three brothers. Now, a 9-year-old California boy has also died. Per the San Diego Union-Tribune, Karl Albright says his nephew Ezekiel Valdivia, who'd been on life support since the Nov. 16 shooting in the Paradise Hills section of San Diego, was pronounced dead late Saturday. Albright added that doctors had proclaimed his nephew brain-dead, per CBS News 8. Ezekiel's father, 31-year-old Jose Valdivia, had turned a gun on Ezekiel, the boy's mother, and his three brothers (ages 3, 5, and 11) the day after mom Sabrina Rosario, 29, had obtained a restraining order against her estranged husband, whom she was trying to divorce.After Rosario filed for the divorce in June, Valdivia started a harassment campaign, showing up at her home and repeatedly texting her, per court and police records; one text included a photo of a handgun with beer cans and a bottle of alcohol in the background. ""This threat really scared me,"" Rosario said, per court documents. KGTV reports Ezekiel's organs will be donated and that he'll be buried with his mother and brothers. ""We had a lot of hope that Ezekiel would make it, and then last night, we lost our hope,"" another relative tells CBS.

"After a cargo ship carrying almost 15,000 sheep overturned off the coast of Romania on Sunday, authorities said all 22 crew members had been rescued—but only 32 sheep. The Queen Hind, which was bound for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a cargo of around 14,600 live sheep, overturned soon after leaving the Romanian port of Constanta, the BBC reports. Authorities say they plan to right the ship and bring it back to port—and they hope the sheep in the ship's hold have survived. A few sheep were rescued from the water, although experts say that with their long fleece, survivors would have been unable to swim for long. It's not clear why the ship overturned, but there have been allegations that it was overloaded.Mary Pana, president of Romania's main livestock breeder association, called for an investigation, AFP reports. ""If we cannot protect livestock during long-distance transports, we should outright ban them,"" she said. Keith Belk from the animal science department at Colorado State University tells the New York Times that such disasters are rare and the international livestock shipping industry has improved standards after some well-publicized incidents.

"Law enforcement agencies in Alabama and beyond posted messages of condolences on social media Sunday in the aftermath of the fatal weekend shooting of a sheriff in the state, the AP reports. Few details were immediately available about the circumstances surrounding Saturday evening's shooting and the capture of an 18-year-old suspect hours later. Gov. Kay Ivey tweeted that Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams had been ""tragically killed"" in the line of duty and that she offered her prayers and sympathy to his family and the county sheriff’s department. Williams is the fifth Alabama law enforcement officer to die from gunfire in the line of duty, and the sixth overall, in 2019, according to a statement from state Attorney General Steve Marshall.The suspect in custody was identified as 18-year-old William Chase Johnson. Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham initially told news outlets that Williams was shot at a gas station. It was unclear what, if any, role race played in the shooting. The sheriff was African American. Meanwhile Sunday, amid messages of condolence from law enforcement agencies, members of the public responded with prayers and well wishes for the sheriff's family. The state had issued an emergency alert late Saturday saying it was seeking an 18-year-old white man last seen around the time of the evening shooting at a QV gas station in the Lowndes County seat of Hayneville, about 20 miles southwest of the capital city of Montgomery.(Read more law enforcement stories.)",neg,"https://www.newser.com/story/283487/condolences-pour-in-after-sheriffs-shooting-death.html

Her last communication was a ""goodnight"" post on Instagram on Saturday night, Newsweek reports. Hara, 28, had attempted suicide earlier this year after an ex-boyfriend had threatened her with violence and the release of a sex video. She was hospitalized at the time, and her agency dropped her. Hara signed with a Japanese agency, resumed working in Japan, and released a single there this month, per Variety. Before starting her solo career, she was in the girl group Kara from 2008 to 2015.Her death is the latest sign of rampant trouble among K-pop stars, who are under tremendous pressure.

"Sandy Hawkins is an unusual bank robbery suspect in several ways: He is 73 years old, he said he wanted to be caught—and he told the teller he had given him too much money, police say. The Florida man is accused of robbing a Boca Raton branch of Wells Fargo on Monday. Police say Hawkins, wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" T-shirt and dark sunglasses, walked into the bank and asked the teller to give him $1,100. When the teller asked for his debit card, Hawkins said it was a robbery and claimed to have a weapon, police say. After the teller counted out $2,000 in $100 bills, Hawkins allegedly said it was too much money and he only wanted $1,100, reports the Palm Beach Post. Police say Hawkins lives near the bank and was not difficult to track down.Police say they found out that the suspect was a former regular at a sports bar in the same strip mall as the bank; the bar gave them his home address. An arrest report states that when officers arrived at the residence, Hawkins said ""I will make this easy "" and handed them a bank deposit slip. Written on the back was ""Give me $1,100 now. No alarms. Hope to get caught."" Friends have no idea why Hawkins, who used to work in the air conditioning industry, would rob a bank, though they say he was devastated by the death of his wife in 2013. ""He lost his wife and he wasn’t happy anymore, that's my theory,"" Addie Cestare, who has known Hawkins for 16 years, tells WPTV.

"A New Zealand jury on Friday found a man guilty of murder in the death of 22-year-old British backpacker Grace Millane. Millane died last December on her birthday after meeting the man through the dating app Tinder, going out for drinks with him, and then returning to his hotel apartment in central Auckland. Prosecutors said the man strangled Millane to death, while defense lawyers argued that the pair had been engaged in consensual erotic choking that went too far, the AP reports. But the jury didn’t buy the defense. After the three-week trial, they deliberated for about five hours on Friday afternoon before returning the guilty verdict. The name of the 27-year-old man is being kept secret for now by court order, a restriction that is sometimes imposed in the New Zealand judicial system.The man will likely face a mandatory life sentence, which comes with a minimum 10-year non-parole period. After he killed her, the man stuffed Millane's body into a suitcase, drove to the Waitakere Ranges forest, and buried her in a shallow grave, where police found her body a week later. Prosecutors said the man took explicit photos of Millane after she died and used Google to search for ""Waitakere Ranges"" and ""hottest fire"" as he tried to figure out how to dispose of her body. Millane's death shocked many in New Zealand, which prides itself on welcoming tourists.

An off-duty police officer in the audience who tried to stop the attack was seriously wounded and underwent surgery. Von Weizsaecker died at the scene despite immediate attention from colleagues.

"In a first-person account at Harper's, editor Wes Enzinna provides a look at what it's like for someone not raking in the big bucks in Silicon Valley to keep a roof over his head. Enzinna, a ""fully employed editor,"" resorted to living in a tiny shack in someone's backyard in Oakland for $240 a month. Picturing a quaint tiny house? Not quite. ""The structure was smaller than a cell at San Quentin—a tiny house or a huge coffin, depending on how you looked at it—four by eight and ten feet tall, so cramped it fit little but a mattress, my suit jackets and ties, a space heater, some novels, and the mason jar I peed in,"" he writes. Drafts meant he could see his breath in cold weather, and weeds sprang up through the floorboards. The shack, as he calls it, was also illegal, given that it didn't have plumbing or electricity (he used an extension cord from the owner's house for the latter).But Enzinna had little choice. Apartments averaged $3,500 a month in San Francisco and $3,000 a month in Oakland. He had only $1,500 to live on after taking care of his non-rent bills, and cheap rooms with housemates had become exceedingly difficult to find, especially for someone with a ""normie career"" like Enzinna's. The story puts Enzinna's personal history into the context of the rich-poor divide in the Bay Area, where techie types are thriving and everyone else seems to be struggling as the cost of living soars. Enzinna began treating himself to the occasional night in a hotel, usually around payday, and he eventually caved and got a relatively cheap studio for $2,600 a month—but within less than six months his credit card debt hit $12,000.

""Apparently he had a lot of stress from that,"" the neighbor tells NBC Los Angeles.""There's nothing really that stands out [about the suspect],"" Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva tells CNN, noting the shootings appeared to be random. ""He wasn't a loner. Wasn't socially awkward. Was involved in student activities. Student athlete. This is kind of out of the blue, shocking pretty much everyone who knew him."" Authorites say Berhow didn't leave behind a manifesto, note, or journal, and didn't appear to be linked to any extremist or violent groups, per CBS News. Meanwhile, CNN reports the two teens who died after Thursday's shooting have been identified as Gracie Anne Muehlberger, 15, and Dominic Blackwell, 14. Of the three injured students, one has already been released from the hospital, while a 14-year-old girl and 15-year-old girl are expected to go home over the next few days.

"A teenager accused of killing two students and injuring three at a California high school was a ""quiet, smart"" kid, according to classmates and neighbors who have no idea why he would carry out a shooting rampage on his 16th birthday. Law enforcement sources identified the Santa Clarita suspect to the Los Angeles Times as Nathaniel Berhow. Authorities say he is in the hospital in ""grave condition"" with a self-inflicted bullet wound. Police say that surveillance video shows that the Saugus High School shooting lasted 16 seconds from the time the shooter took a .45 caliber handgun from his backpack and opened fire, apparently at random. Sheriff Alex Villeneuva says that when he shot himself, the teen seemed aware that he was down to his last bullet. All six students were taken to a hospital, where a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy died. More:Instagram account. Investigators trying to determine a motive say they are investigating an Instagram account that apparently belongs to the teen. Before the shooting, the message ""Saugus, have fun at school tomorrow"" was posted. Police Capt. Kent Wegener said Friday that a third party changed the message to something else after the shooting, CNN reports. He said it wasn't clear if a friend or a hacker was responsible.""One of those normal kids."" A student in the suspect's physics class tells the AP that he seemed like ""one of those normal kids.""

"The incestuous couple who killed two of their six children learned their fate Tuesday: Sarah Barrass and Brandon Machin, half-siblings, were both sentenced to life in prison, the Guardian reports. Barrass and Machin, who live in England, were afraid their children were going to be taken into care when they strangled Tristan and Blake Barrass, ages 13 and 14, in May. Barrass, 35, and Machin, 39, first forced their four oldest children to take a number of pills used to treat ADHD; when that only made the children sick, Barrass searched online for other ways to kill them before ultimately strangling Tristan with a cord from her dressing gown as Machin strangled Blake with his hands. They then placed trash bags over the teens' heads to suffocate them, and also tried to kill one of their younger children by drowning the child in a bathtub.""The six children lived alone with their mother, Sarah Barrass,"" the prosecutor explained in court. ""The picture of the Sarah Barrass household prior to the events in 2019 was, to the outside world, a household of a loving single mum with six children, heavily supported by her brother Brandon Machin."" The children believed their father had been killed in a war, but in reality, Machin, who shares a mother with Barrass, was the father of them all. Barrass and Machin became concerned their incestuous relationship would be found out, the BBC reports. ""They decided the children were better off dead than in care,"" the prosecutor said. Police say Barrass told them she had planned to kill herself after her children were dead. She and Machin must serve a minimum of 35 years behind bars. Two of the surviving children are under age 13, and the other two are under age 3.

"San Diego State University has placed 14 fraternities on suspension after the death of a Phi Gamma Delta pledge. The county medical examiner's office says Dylan Hernandez was hospitalized on Thursday morning after he was found unresponsive in his dorm room, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. Hernandez, who turned 19 a few weeks ago, had attended a fraternity event Wednesday night. No cause of death was disclosed and it's not clear whether it was alcohol-related. The Daily Aztec reports that the 14 fraternities in the university's Interfraternity Council—who spent much of last year under a party ban—were placed under suspension Friday. Six were already suspended and four more were being investigated.""As a mother, nothing can replace the profound loss of a child, and the devastating heartbreak the family and their loved ones are experiencing,"" SDSU President Adela de la Torrie said in a statement. ""All of us in the Aztec family are sending our prayers, and are here to support the family."" She said last week that there had been ""possible misconduct"" leading to Hernandez's hospitalization. Last year, Will Fritz wrote a Daily Aztec editorial warning that somebody could end up dead if fraternities continued ignoring alcohol policies. ""We knew that somebody could die, and now it has happened,"" he said Monday. ""I can’t imagine how his parents are feeling.""

"The Florida mother who claimed that she woke up last Wednesday to find her 5-year-old daughter missing is now a person of interest in the investigation, police confirmed Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Brianna Williams, a 27-year-old US Navy petty officer, has not talked to investigators since last week, when she stopped cooperating after they asked about inconsistencies in her story, reports First Coast News. Police have urged anybody who saw Brianna Williams and her daughter, Taylor Rose Williams, together in recent weeks to contact them. They are especially interested in hearing from anybody who might have seen them traveling between Florida and Alabama in a black 2017 Honda Accord.Jacksonville police have sent teams to Alabama's Marengo County, where Williams went to high school and much of her extended family still lives, to search for the girl, reports the Florida Times-Union. ""There are a lot of different efforts going on... There are search efforts that are underway,"" the sheriff said Monday. ""We still have other leads we are focusing on as well. The information that drove us to Alabama demanded this kind of response, and we absolutely hope to find her alive."" The sheriff said he couldn't confirm the last time Taylor was seen alive. The FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service have joined the investigation.

"A family of eight was enjoying an afternoon of fishing on the Southern California coast when three members were swept off rocks and into the sea. All three unidentified victims were pulled from the water before 5pm Thursday but ultimately died, Capt. Brian McGrath of the Ventura County Fire Department tells NBC News. The family had been fishing ""near the notoriously slippery crags and small beaches between Point Mugu and Leo Carrillo state parks along Pacific Coast Highway"" when a wave crashed in, sending the victims into the water, per the Los Angeles Times. ""When we got on scene … we were able to rescue all three out of the water. However, they were fatally injured,"" McGrath tells NBC. Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow says all three were pronounced dead at the scene. ""Unfortunately, it can be a dangerous place because it is very rocky and the beach and sand slopes straight down,"" he tells the Times of the scene, not far from the Ventura County-Los Angeles County line. ""Things can look very calm one moment, but every once in a while you can have a large wave that can crash down upon you.""",neg,https://www.newser.com/story/292791/rogue-wave-kills-3-members-of-family.html
